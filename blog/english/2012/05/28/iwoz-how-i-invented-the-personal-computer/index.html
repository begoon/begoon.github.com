<p>A quote from the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe anything really revolutionary has ever been invented by committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh!? Only for the sake of this quote this book is worth to be read.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/english/2011/12/27/steve-jobs-the-exclusive-biography/">Steve Jobs biography</a> was interesting reading, even quite long though. Steve Wozniak&rsquo;s book is much shorter, and also closer to people with engineering background.</p>

<p>Steve Wozniak tells a story how it all happened. How he spent nights at school time designing, re-designing, then again and again re-designing non-existent yet computers just on paper. It helped him develop a unique habit to always use a minimum number of chips in his circuit designs. A perfect example is a first floppy disk controller for the Apple 2 computer. Instead of a complicated and costly purely hardware solution he put a few chips and then implemented the rest in 6502 assembly language, having masterly fulfilled requirements for signal timings. Additionally, he designed, again using a few chips, a state machine, which he programmed directly in 4-bit machines codes also designed by himself (a handmade programmable logic matrix approach). Eventually, at some day Steve had invented the Apple 2, a revolutionary personal computer with the color TV-display and the full keyboard. By the way, contrary to the ordinary opinion, Jobs didn&rsquo;t participate in its development. In a few years that computer made both Steves multi millionaires and started the Apple Computers. It is no wonder that the Apple surpassed everybody on the market &ndash; it was simpler, cheaper and have a bunch of unique features.</p>

<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of the story. After Steve got into a plan crash on a small airplane, operating himself, and after that incident he was suffering from partial amnesia for some time. Then he quit Apple, and, again, contrary to the ordinary opinion, he wasn&rsquo;t fired, suspended or something because they all had quarreled. He just wanted to start another project &ndash; a universal remote control for consumer electronics. Formally, till now Steve is still an Apple employee, even with a salary.</p>

<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t also the end of the story. For some reason Steve decided to organize an open air rock gig, a festival, similar to Woodstock. In fact, he did a few of them. Of course, the technology was involved. These festivals had a live satellite connection to USSR (they used equipment installed for the Olympic games in Moscow in the eightieth), right through the &ldquo;iron curtain&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After that Steve taught bases of computers at school for more than ten years and was engaged in philanthropy.</p>

<p>The whole slice of the book is also devoted to pranks Steve have been constantly doing through his life. For example, a Dial-A-Joke service he ran in his own apartment, or a portable TV jammer, and that big one, &ldquo;The Zaltair Prank&rdquo;, when Steve spread a rumor about a competing computer company, called Zaltair (remember The Altair which launched Bill Gates to the orbit?). Even Jobs believed it and only after years realised that it was a setup.</p>

<p>So, if you have at least a little interest in biographies, it is worth to read this engaging story about the good fellow, genius engineer, who transformed the industry of personal computers once and for all.</p>
