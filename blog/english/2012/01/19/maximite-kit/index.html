    <h1>Maximite - 8-bit nostalgia with a soldering iron</h1>
<div id="post">
  <p>Recently I have come across an interesting project - Maximite.</p>

<p>This is a micro-computer based on Microchip PIC32 running BASIC. It is so simple that even a novice can build it in a few hours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0099.jpg" /></p>

<p>It is a bit more powerful than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_hardware_in_Soviet_Bloc_countries#Radio-86RK">Radio-86RK</a> and ZX Spectrum 48. But its peripherals are fantastic: SD/FAT card, USB, VGA, PS/2, timers, RS232, I2C, SPI, PWM, ADC/DAC and individual general purpose pins.</p>

<p>If you build it on a mock up board buying parts by yourself, it will cost less then ten Australian dollars.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://geoffg.net/maximite.html">project is open-sourced</a> (schematics, PCB artwork, sources).</p>

<p>Even if quickly flip through the <a href="http://mmbasic.com/downloads.html">documentation</a>, no doubts - a list features is impressive. All peripherals are available directly from BASIC.</p>

<p>Programs and data can be stored on a SD card. If there is a &ldquo;AUTORUN.BAS&rdquo; file on the card, BASIC will run at the start.</p>

<p>I liked Maximite, but soldering is not my favourite activity. Unfortunately it is only possible to buy a kit, but not a fully assembled unit.</p>

<p>I ordered the <a href="http://www.altronics.com.au/index.asp?area=item&amp;id=K9550">kit from Altronics</a> and soon after it arrived.</p>

<p>Only the microprocessor was already soldered because soldering such form factor chip isn’t an easy task.</p>

<p>Anyway, screw it, let’s do it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0102.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here a few parts are already in place. I’m not a complete newbie in soldering but last time I took a soldering iron in my hands was about five years ago. I had no acid for soldering, so I was crumbling rosin right to soldering points. The effect is similar to acid. The soldering iron (the one on the plate) with a sharp sting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0103.jpg" /></p>

<p>I spent the first hour struggling with only a few parts, but eventually it went smoother.</p>

<p>A half is ready.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0106.jpg" /></p>

<p>After one more hour it was all done.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0107.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0110.jpg" /></p>

<p>Maximite can be powered from an external 9V source or form USB. I used USB.</p>

<p>Plug into USB and VGA. An off you go!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0111.jpg" /></p>

<p>BASIC is ready but there is no keyboard. I hand’t a proper PS/2 one and I tried a USB-PS/2 connector. Alas, it didn’t fit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0119.jpg" /></p>

<p>Next day I found the PS/2 keyboard and finally connected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0114.jpg" /></p>

<p>The case.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0115.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0112.jpg" /></p>

<p>Fully assembled.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0113.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0116.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have to admit - the kit from Altronics is a very good quality product. The holes are metallized on the board, and the case fits perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0118.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then I had to upgrade the firmware to the latest version. Maximite can flash itself over USB without a special programmer. Just open the case and hold a special button when switching Maximite on. It goes to a boot loader mode.</p>

<p>Maximite is a standard CDC device in USB infrastructure. Windows still requires a driver though, but Mac has it built-in.</p>

<p>Plug-in.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01130.jpg" /></p>

<p>Flashing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01129.jpg" /></p>

<p>Right, the firmware is upgraded up to 3.0A.</p>

<p>As I said, Maximite supports VGA and PS/2, but you can also connect it to a PC via USB. In this case Maximite mirrors the VGA output to that serial connection to the PC, also treats the data coming from that connection as keyboard input.</p>

<p>So, it is possible to detach VGA and PS/2 at all and talk to Maximite over the serial USB connection only.</p>

<p>For example, VGA dispay (voltmeter):</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01125.jpg" /></p>

<p>The same data on in a terminal emulation application on the PC:</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01123.jpg" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, Maximite works with pixels, not characters. So when a character is being displayed, it is also copied to the console, but when Maxitile draws graphics it is not visible in the serial console.</p>

<p>BASIC language in Maximite gives full control over the peripherals using operators.</p>

<p>There is an archive of BASIC programs running on Maximite available of the project website.</p>

<p>There are a few screenshots.</p>

<p>Clock.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01132.jpg" /></p>

<p>Character editor.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01128.jpg" /></p>

<p>Voltmeter.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01133.jpg" /></p>

<p>Puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01126.jpg" />
<img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01131.jpg" /></p>

<p>I believe, no comment here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01134.jpg" /></p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Every penny I have spent on Maximite is worth that fun I’ve got.</p>

<p>The Maximite project is surprisingly solid. Everything is nice and simple. And it works!</p>

<p>For beginners, even kids, interested in microelectronics, Maximite is simply a godsend. Easy and nice to build. I as an amateur have built everything in a few hours only.</p>

<p>When my brother was building <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">Radio-86RK Emulator</a> and Spectrum about twenty years ago, there was a joke about DIY projects published in radio electronics magazines: if a author says that his device doesn’t required any tuning, there is at least a little chance to get it working; but the author says that his device does require some minor tuning&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to come back to your 8-bit youth with a soldering iron in hands — build Maximite.</p>
