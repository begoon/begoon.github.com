    <h1>GitHub as a blog engine</h1>
<div id="post">
  <p>To say that Blogspot (Blogger) infuriates me is to say nothing. The only benefit of it is fast indexing by Google.</p>

<p>Artemy Lebedev said that he despises all this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> bullshit because it is much more productive to focus on creating great posts rather than thinking how to attract more readers. His <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/">LJ</a> uses a default template without even minor tweaks to make it looking “cool”. Despite of this his blog is in Russian Top 10.</p>

<p>Nobody reads blogs directly nowadays. Everybody uses Google Reader or other aggregators making the design of blogs absolutely pointless.</p>

<p>Anyway let’s leave odious Lebedev and come back to our techy blogs. Tom Preston-Werner, one of the Github founders, <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">said that he wanted to write posts</a> but not tweaking different templates or keeping the version of WordPress or Mephisto up to date.</p>

<p>A similar thought haunts me from the day one of using Blogspot. Only recently I have sorted a way of creating post by using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">ReST</a>. Now I write posts in this markup and convert to HTML before publishing by a few handcrafted scripts. Unfortunately hosting for images is not automated in anyway.</p>

<p>Many times I wanted to migrate to a standalone platform, for example, WordPress. But my laziness and unwillingness to spend even a second on its maintenance always stopped me.</p>

<p>At the moment I have another attack of hate to Blogspot and as a consequence look for alternatives.</p>

<p>Surprisingly I never considered using <a href="http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/static_blog_generators.html">static blog engines</a>.</p>

<p>What if just simply migrate to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>? It converts one of your repositories to a website which can be also processed by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static engine from Tom Preston-Werner.</p>

<p>I could kill a few birds with one stone – to use a proper markup language, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a>, instead of bloody HTML and to manage publishing by git. Of course ReST is better but I can cope with it.</p>

<p>Also GitHub Pages can be integrated with your own domain if needed.</p>

<p>Comments and discussions. <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> seems to be an easiest way to sort it without any hassle.</p>

<p>Google Analytics perfectly works with any engine where you can insert their JavaScript hook into pages.</p>

<p>What is still missing?</p>

<p>Sometimes people still visit blogs directly, for instance, to find previous posts or explore “social” details. In this case all these bells and whistles in a form of JavaScript gadgets are very useful and save a lot of time. Blogspot allows adding them in a few clicks.</p>

<p>But coming back to the question at the beginning – do I really need them? If the content is interesting the audience will inevitably find you. A word of mouth in a form of Twitter or Facebook will attract people. But if the content is crap all those bells and whistles (and SEO) will not help.</p>
