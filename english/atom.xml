<p>This device allows to connect legacy RS-232 devices to the world of TCP/IP. We used such things years ago developing software for POSes and ATMs. Just change a dialing script from something like <code>ATDT12345678</code> to <code>ATD192.168.1.1</code> and off you go.</p>

<p>Have no idea what to do with this now. I even have no proper RS-232 port, only via a USB cable. Interestingly, back those days such devices were very expensive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working on <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/07/interview-with-geoff-graham/">the interview with Geoff Graham</a>, he told me about a book where he took a lot of inspiration and working code as well for the Maximite software.</p>

<p>I stopped programming for PICs about ten year ago when we were developing a GSM phone based alarm system. We used the PIC16 chip and a DTFM decoder (be the way, the feature of controlling the alarm system dialing to it and using DTFM signals was pretty awesome that time) and a bunch of sensors.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/sms-alarm-system.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>I also worked with PIC12. I was stunned of just an 8-pin chip <strong>programmable in C</strong>!</p>

<p>Then I moved to the UK and left a lot of stuff at home. But recently it all has come back when I built <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/">Maximite</a> and <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/11/raspberry-pi-arrived/">also bought</a> <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/26/raspberry-pi-links/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Since then the technology has stepped forward, of course. Now PIC32 chips are based on the MIPS kernel, almost fully 32-bit and have a primitive virtual memory capabilities. It allows creating simple operating systems when the kernel has its own protected memory from users processes. For example, <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/05/11/retrobsd-on-maximite/">RetroBSD perfectly works on Maximite</a>.</p>

<p>Back to the book. I wanted to refresh my PIC knowledge and opened the book. To my surprise I swallowed it in a couple of evenings non-stop.</p>

<p>The book is organized perfectly and suitable for people having minimal experience in microcontrollers. But it covers serious topics such that:</p>

<ul>
<li>memory model</li>
<li>interrupts (for example, timers or I/O)</li>
<li>serial or parallel interfaces (for example, connecting to a LCD display or a PS/2 keyboard)</li>
<li>ADC/DAC (for example, a temperature sensor or an analog joystick)</li>
<li>generating black/white video signal (for example, composite or VGA) using non-trivial DMA-based data transfer for a memory buffer to the SPI channel</li>
<li>SD/MMC cards interface</li>
<li>implementation of the FAT</li>
<li>sound generation via PWM</li>
</ul>

<p>All example are complete and working. It can be even better if you have a companion CD of the book.</p>

<p>The only little issue was that the author used MPLAB and the C32 compiler (remember, the book was released in 2008), but Microchip strongly recommend migrating to MPLAB-X (which, by the way, the only choice for Linux and OSX) and the XC32 compiler based on GCC. Of course, the project files can be easily converted to the new MPLAB-X format, the book lacks examples of simple Makefiles. But it compensates it with exhaustive screenshots and commentaries about configuration windows, the debugger and the simulator. It is possible to read the book even without a computer.</p>

<p>If you read the book, you&rsquo;ll understand what can be implemented with PIC32 and how things work in it. If you decide to implement a project, you have enough examples plus understanding how to start the crystal.</p>

<p><strong>The conclusion</strong>: Highly recommended.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my guest is Geoff Graham, the creator of a popular homebrew
microcomputer called <a href="http://geoffg.net/maximite.html">Maximite</a>. Nowadays we see a boom of projects
based on microcontrollers. We still call them &ldquo;microcontrollers&rdquo; on a
habit but they are not anymore. For example, Microchip PIC32 crystals
provide much more functionality in a single chip than we had in
full-blown microcomputers from the 80th, like Apple 2 or ZX Spectrum
48.</p>

<p>When I found that the PIC32 chip could be made to use a VGA display
and keyboard, it was only natural that I should try and recreate one

</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Geoff built a microcomputer, Maximite, using a PIC32 chip. Maximite is
a complete appliance utilizing modern interfaces. It uses VGA for
video, PS/2 for the keyboard, SD cards as storage, USB for
communicating, and it runs BASIC! Doesn&rsquo;t it remind you something? In
my view, Maximite is a perfect tool to study microelectronics allowing
to touch how hardware meets with software.</p>

<p>Today we can ask Geoff a few questions in person. Geoff lives in the
suburb of Kensington in Perth, Western Australia. Perth is a long way
from anywhere but with the wonders of the Internet and FedEx the world
is a much smaller place now, so it doesn&rsquo;t stop Geoff to design and
produce great hardware and software.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Geoff, thanks for the interview. Let&rsquo;s begin with a light
question &ndash; why &ldquo;Maximite&rdquo;? How did you invent this name?</strong></p>

<p>At the beginning of the project I wanted to call it The Mighty Mite
meaning something that was small (mite) that was also powerful
(mighty).  When the design came to be published in Silicon Chip
magazine the editor discovered that the name had been trademarked by a
food manufacturer, so he suggested Maximite as an alternative.  By
then I could think of nothing better, so that became the name.  As it
turned out, that is also the name of an explosive which, in a strange
sort of way, is also appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Maximite is very popular. Do you know at least rough figures of how many of them were built? Also when and how did you realise its incredible popularity?</strong></p>

<p>My standard answer is that &ldquo;thousands are in use&rdquo; but I believe that a
more accurate number is somewhere between 3000 and 4000.  About half
of them have been built by people with a soldering iron and the other
half purchased as an assembled board from companies who make copies of
the design.</p>

<p>I realised that it would be popular when I looked at the number of
visitors to my website, in the first few days after the magazine
article appeared the number of unique visitors to my website jumped by
100 times before settling down to a long term increase of 20 times the
pre Maximite days.  What was interesting was that my URL did not
appear in the first magazine article so many people read the article
and immediately used Google to find out more.</p>

<p>When I started on the design of the Maximite I was thinking of the
computers of the 80&rsquo;s which provided me with a lot of fun with back
then.  They were very popular in their day and, as the modern
computers have become more complicated and difficult to use, there was
a vacuum left behind.  I believe that the key to the success of the
Maximite was that it filled that space.</p>

<p><strong>For Maximite you had to build hardware and software. This is quite an unusual position nowadays for people working with computers. Professionals in software rarely look at hardware and vice versa. Where are you here? Are you more a hardware engineer by nature or a programmer?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that is one of the things that I have found since the Maximite
design was published.  People tend to look at it through the eyes of a
hardware engineer and do not appreciate the software - they want to
add electronic features without regard to the firmware or how the
BASIC language could accommodate them.  There is always the reverse
too, people who only think in terms of the software.  I think that I
am best described as a programmer but with a strong electronic
background.</p>

<p>Another item that is often missed when people try to change the
Maximite is its &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; (ie, how the user uses it).  This must
be consistent with the hardware and software.  All three are part of
the integrated whole and this is often not appreciated by either the
hardware or software specialists.</p>

<p><strong>I personally was amazed of how solid and complete the Maximite
project is. You designed the board, the case, software, and the kits
of Maximite are available online. In the world of individual homebrew
projects people usually don&rsquo;t tend to finish off their projects fully
to such a polished shape because they loose interest. How did you
manage that?</strong></p>

<p>This primarily came from my desire to have the project published in
Silicon Chip magazine.  Most of their projects are a complete
&ldquo;product&rdquo; designed by a professional engineer and I had to meet that
standard if I wanted them to publish the Maximite project.  This
attention to detail is unusual today as magazines tend to only half
finish the project, things like documentation, a box to put it in, a
nice front panel and so on are often ignored.</p>

<p>I find that the discipline of designing projects for the magazine is
quite good.  I have a number of personal projects (ie, ones not
published by the magazine) that are still sitting around today in a
half completed form because I do not have that discipline operating on
me.</p>

<p><strong>Geoff, you started your microelectronics hobby when you retired. How
much time a day you usually spend on it? Again, you delivered the
Maximite project in a such complete form, so seems it required some
time to put everything in place.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I have spent far too much time on it since I have retired, but
interestingly it was something that I had to do.  It is as if there
was a design engineer hiding inside of me that could not get out while
I was following my professional career (which was not in electronics).<br />
The moment I retired he broke forth.</p>

<p>With the Maximite things seem to come in bursts, I would spend twelve
hours a day for a month or two then have a break for a few weeks.  It
is good that I enjoy working on projects like this because they do
take up a lot of time.  I estimate that the Maximite has taken about
nine months of solid eight hours a day, forty hours a week to get it
to where it is now.</p>

<p><strong>MMBasic. I know you struggled to find software for Maximite. A few
existing implementations of BASIC you tried didn&rsquo;t really fit, and you
ended up with your own implementation of BASIC. Could clarify the
licensing and distribution model of MMBasic? Any plans, maybe, to
develop a Maximite framework or a library allowing to deal with
Maximite peripherals in the form of device drivers? It could be useful
in developing alternative firmware for Maximite, for example, running
Lua or RetroBSD.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, when I started on the Maximite project my hope was to find a free
version of BASIC in the Internet and use that.  But I found that the
good implementations of the language were not available freely or had
some other issue.  So I decided to write my own.</p>

<p>Initially I released my version of BASIC (called MMBasic) under the
GPL GNU licence but I had a bad experience with one commercial
organisation who removed my name from the software and claimed it as
theirs, they even changed the copyright to their name.  So I created
my own license where the software is freely available but it cannot be
redistributed without my agreement.</p>

<p>This has worked out very well, a number of universities and commercial
organisations are using it and I have an agreement with them covering
what they will do with it.  This is much better than allowing someone
to anonymously download my software and then see it appear on the
Internet with their name and copyright.</p>

<p>At this time I do not have plans to develop a loadable device driver
type of architecture.  The main reason is that the PIC32 chip does not
have enough memory to do all the things that it already does (VGA,
keyboard, USB, etc) and implement a loadable device driver system.<br />
There are more powerful chips around but they are impossible to hand
solder so I have stayed with the PIC32.  Products like the Raspberry
Pi can have loadable device drivers but they also have a complex
operating system - just what I was trying to avoid with the Maximite.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s move a bit to your personal background. When and how did you
study to solder, for instance? I know many people looking for some
experience in electronics but they are afraid of soldering seeing it
potentially difficult or even impossible. How would you recommend
people starting messing around with electronics hands-on?</strong></p>

<p>I cannot remember when I first started soldering but it was probably
around age 12.  I am probably the wrong person to ask but I cannot see
the problem with soldering &ndash; you only need a cheap soldering iron and
some wire solder.</p>

<p>One of the great things with electronics is that it can be a very
cheap hobby.  I would recommend starting with a simple and cheap
project like flashing a light or adding a clock chip to the Arduino
and just buy the bits including the soldering iron.  You might make a
mess of the first project but that is not important and by the time
you have reached the third project you will regard yourself as almost
professional.</p>

<p><strong>Would you recommend any books or websites where beginners could make
their first easy steps into the wonderful world in electronics? What
kind of minimal level of knowledge could be enough to design and
build, for example, Maximite?</strong></p>

<p>My recommendation would be to start with a magazine subscription.
There is Silicon Chip (in Australia), Elektor (in Europe) and Nuts and
Volts (in the USA).  All of these will accept international
subscriptions.  If you are starting with no knowledge at all probably
Nuts and Volts would be the best.  When you subscribe to a magazine
you will have a constant stream of ideas and projects to tempt you
into trying something different and fun.  So a subscription is well
worth the cost.</p>

<p>The level of knowledge required to build the Maximite is not great
because it comes already designed and with working software.  On the
other hand, to design it you would need a great amount of expertise.
I have a lot of expensive test gear, I trained as an electronics
engineer in my early days and I have about 30 years of experience in
systems programming - all that is necessary to create something like
the Maximite.</p>

<p><strong>Now we have plenty websites providing a marketplace for individual
hardware developers to sell their ideas and designs, for example,
SparkFun.com. The internet allows people to get some money from hobby.
You, as a person, whose hardware designs are being wildly sold over
the internet, do you think it is feasible to live on income from such
business? or volumes are still minor?</strong></p>

<p>It would be very hard to make a living income from that sort of thing.
There are a few, like the designers of the Arduino, who are probably
doing OK but there are many more who have to keep another job so that
they can pay the rent.  Part of the problem is people like me who
produce sophisticated designs and then give them away for free, it is
hard to compete with that and your customers come to expect products
or software as a very low price.</p>

<p><strong>A bit of personal stuff. Can you name any people, for example, engineers or programmers, which you did or would like to learn from?</strong></p>

<p>The programmer who was the most influential on me is Brian Kernighan
who, along with Dennis Ritchie, designed the C programming language
and wrote a book on it called &ldquo;The C Programming Language&rdquo; in 1978.
Even today that book is a wonderful introduction to the C programming
language and well worth a read if you want to get into programming in
C.  When I write my magazine articles and web pages I always remember
his clear and easy writing style and try to emulate it in what I do.</p>

<p>Probably the most influential engineer is Jim Rowe who was creating
projects and writing for electronics magazines in Australia when I was
a young teenager.  He is still doing it today 50 years later and I
always find his projects well designed and his magazine articles clear
and easy to understand.  He is someone else who I try to emulate in my
projects and articles.</p>

<p><strong>By the way, how did you come to the world of computers and
engineering? What was your first computer or programming language?</strong></p>

<p>This will date me somewhat (I am 64 years old).  I remember the Altair
computer when it was first released and a little later the company I
was working for became the distributor for Intel in Australia.  I was
studying as an electronics engineer at the time and my first computer
was one that I hand soldered using the Intel 8080 chip and 512 bytes
of RAM (yes bytes).</p>

<p>Back then BASIC was the only language that you could use because of
the limited memory capacity and hardware.  Much later, when we had
disk drives, you could use more sophisticated languages and in my time
I have written programs in most of them (Fortran, COBOL, PL/1,
assembler, Pascal, etc).</p>

<p>As you can see, I was involved in electronics, small computers and
BASIC a long time ago.  So, when I found that the PIC32 chip could be
made to use a VGA display and keyboard, it was only natural that I
should try and recreate one of the earlier computers that I had so
much fun with in my youth.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping up, I&rsquo;d like to ask you to shed some light on your future
projects? Is Maximite finished or we should wait for the Maximite with
Ethernet or WiFi or something?</strong></p>

<p>There is the new Colour Maximite that will be published in the
September 2012 issue of Silicon Chip.  It will have eight colours on a
VGA display, stereo synthesised sound and an Arduino compatible
connector along with all the other features of the original Maximite
(USB, BASIC language, etc).  That has taken quite a lot of my time and
energy to create, so after it is published I might take a break for a
while before looking around for something else.</p>

<p>There is a couple of exclusive photos of the new colour Maximite.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Thanks, Geoff, for the interview and for Maximite. Looking forward
for your further projects.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m personally incredibly excited that
today people have started to realise that teaching computers is not
only about Word and Excel, but also about understanding what is inside
and how all these guts actually work. And projects like Raspberry Pi
and your Maximite help enormously get beginners a bit closer to the
metal.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t met a hotel with properly installed WiFi coverage. Many can put a cable, but proper WiFi coverage with decent speed &ndash; no one. But this device makes you an ad-hoc instant router in minutes with no pain whatsoever.</p>

<p>P.S. By the way, a question &ndash; is WiFi hardware (chipset) in laptops, for instance, and regular WiFi access points different in any way? If the connection is duplex, it shouldn&rsquo;t be. So, how to turn a laptop into a proper WiFi access point then? I tried things like <a href="http://connectify.me/">Connectify</a> on Windows 7, but it didn&rsquo;t really work properly. And what should I also do on Linux and OSX?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Playing with <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/11/raspberry-pi-arrived/">Raspberry Pi</a> I have collected a bunch of
more or less useful links, so I decided to put them all together.</p>

<h2>Initial re-partitioning</h2>

<p>At the time of this writing the standard Debian images (stable)
distributed from the official Raspberry Pi website were built
for 2GB SD cards. It is possible to copy them to larger cards
and it will work but space above 2GB will be wasted.</p>

<p>There are a few simple steps to re-partition the card after
the first boot.</p>

<p>Images:</p>

<p>Step by step:</p>

<p>In short:</p>

<pre><code>printf &quot;d\n3\nd\n2\nn\np\n2\n157696\n\nw\n&quot; | sudo fdisk -cu /dev/mmcblk0
sudo shutdown -r now
sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

<h2>Complete I2C setup on Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p><a href="http://robot-electronics.co.uk/files/rpi_i2c_setup.doc">http://robot-electronics.co.uk/files/rpi_i2c_setup.doc</a></p>

<p>Set up for using i2c with Raspberry Pi running the standard Debian
squeeze distribution.</p>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade 
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
</code></pre>

<p>Install hexxeh&rsquo;s rpi-upgrade tool <a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#readme:">https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update#readme:</a></p>

<pre><code>sudo wget http://goo.gl/1BOfJ -O /usr/bin/rpi-update
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update
sudo apt-get install git-core

sudo rpi-update
</code></pre>

<p>Restart rpi for updates to finish:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre>

<p>Download Chris Boots&rsquo;s kernel with the i2c drivers in as a Debian package
from his website <a href="http://bootc.net">http://bootc.net</a>. Navigate to where the Debian package
was saved using command line and install the Debian package.</p>

<pre><code>dpkg -i linux-image-3.2.18-rpi1+_5_armel.deb
</code></pre>

<p>Copy /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.18rpi1+ to /boot/kernel.img:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.18rpi+ /boot/kernel.img
</code></pre>

<p>Restart RPi again:</p>

<pre><code>sudo shutdown -r now
</code></pre>

<p>Download i2c-tools:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
</code></pre>

<p>If you run ls /dev/i2c* you will not be able to see any i2c ports
(e.g. /dev/i2c-0) listed. At start up the i2c ports will not be active.
Make it active using modprobe:</p>

<pre><code>sudo modprobe i2c-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Now look to see if your i2c ports exist in /dev:</p>

<pre><code>ls /dev/i2c*
i2cdetect -l
dmesg | grep i2c
</code></pre>

<p>You should see two i2c ports listed named /dev/i2c-0 and /dev/i2c-1.
/dev/i2c-0 is the one we will be using.  Another way of listing them
is to run i2cdetect -l (a tool that came with the i2c-tools you installed
earlier).</p>

<p>Change permissions of the i2c-0 port to let you access:</p>

<pre><code>sudo chmod 666 /dev/i2c-0
</code></pre>

<p>You should now be able to download and run some of our example c code.
You will need to modprobe i2c-dev and change the permissions of the i2c
port every time you boot up as these setting are not saved by default.</p>

<h2>Checking Firmware Version</h2>

<p>Firmware should be up-to-date. Its update is harmless and cannot
brick your RPi.</p>

<pre><code>/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd version
</code></pre>

<h2>RPI update</h2>

<h3>Method 1</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update">https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update</a></p>

<pre><code>wget https://raw.github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update/master/rpi-update -O /usr/bin/rpi-update &amp;&amp; chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update

sudo apt-get install ca-certificates
rpi-update
</code></pre>

<h3>Method 2</h3>

<p><a href="http://iroylabs.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/raspberrypi-mouse-and-keyboard-does-not.html">http://iroylabs.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/raspberrypi-mouse-and-keyboard-does-not.html</a></p>

<pre><code>wget https://raw.github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update/master/rpi-update
chmod +x rpi-update
mv rpi-update /usr/bin/rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to build my own USB loader for <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/04/gmc-4/">GMC-4</a>. Following the advice of Serg Vakulenko, the following board was purchased:</p>

</p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/762">USB Bit Whacker</a>, a development board based on PIC18. Its default firmware allows to control I/O pins via <a href="http://schmalzhaus.com/UBW/Doc/FirmwareDDocumentation_v149.html">simple commands</a> over a virtual serial port.</p>

<p>Schematic.</p>

<p>I was lazy to etch the board, so soldered manually. Looks unsightly but works.</p>

<p>After all, GMC-4 is THE thing!</p>

<p>P.S. The sources are available on Github &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/begoon/gmc4-loader/">gmc4-loader</a>. I suspect that in Python or Ruby it might be much nicer, but it was a nice exercise programming serial ports in UNIX.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today my guest is <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/people/anthony_williams.html">Anthony Williams</a>, the author of the recently
released book &ldquo;C++ Concurrency in Action&rdquo;. Residing in West Cornwall
and being able to see the sea from his office, Anthony develops and
maintains C++ libraries, participates in proposals for the C++
standard and runs a company called &ldquo;<a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/">Just Software solutions</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless the multithreaded code is going to
be clearly faster, then writing single-threaded code will save you a
lot of headaches.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>I recently purchased his book about concurrency in C++. To be honest I
haven&rsquo;t met better material so far about C++ 2011 memory model. Today
we have an opportunity to ask Anthony a few questions, and, of course,
particularly about C++.</p>

<p><strong>Hi Anthony, thanks for the interview, and let me begin from
afar. Programming, computers, C++&hellip; Why had you chosen this way? What
dragged you on this route of bits and bytes?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been interested in computers, and it turned out that I was
reasonably good at programming them. We had a Sinclair ZX81 at home,
and a BBC Micro at school when I was around 7 or 8, and it all started
from there. I used to examine the source code of the games to see how
they worked. When it came time to apply for jobs after my degree, I
was quite clear in my mind that I wanted to do programming. It
was fun, interesting, challenging, and you got paid for it!</p>

<p><strong>I suspect that C++ wasn&rsquo;t the first language you&rsquo;ve learned. Have
you ever programmed in some unusual languages at early days?</strong></p>

<p>C++ wasn&rsquo;t around when I started programming, so no it wasn&rsquo;t the
first language I learned. I started with BASIC. All home computers had
some variety of BASIC built in, and it was a while before I realised
there was anything else. Some programs were written in machine code,
so I learnt that next &mdash; converting Z80 assembly language to hex
codes by hand and typing them in as DATA statements of a BASIC loader
program.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve programmed in anything that was really unusual, but
I&rsquo;ve used quite a few languages for various different
systems. Programming a PIC with only 100 bytes of program space was a
challenge, and I don&rsquo;t suspect many people ever programmed the Psion
Organizer II, though the programming language for it was similar to
BASIC in many ways.</p>

<p><strong>Can you recall any influential or maybe even outstanding books that
helped establish yourself in the career?</strong></p>

<p>Hmm. It would have to be the Z80 programming reference I had when I
was around 10 or 11. I can&rsquo;t remember the title, but I devoured that
book. I knew every instruction by heart, including the hex opcodes and
the clock counts. I found a similar guide to the 8086 on a shareware
disk when we got a PC, printed it out and devoured that too.</p>

<p>These days my bookshelves have books like Design Patterns,
Refactoring, and The Art of Computer Programming, though I still like
to keep &ldquo;close to the metal&rdquo; with things like Intel&rsquo;s Software
Optimization Cookbook.</p>

<p><strong>Now C++, and concurrency. Missing on opportunity for a few
questions to the expert seems to be not such a good idea. So, to begin
with, what don&rsquo;t you like in the C++ 2011 concurrency support?</strong></p>

<p>Good question! I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything that I can point at and
say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way that works&rdquo;. I think it was a shame the
&ldquo;is_ready()&rdquo; function got removed from future and shared_future, since
it&rsquo;s useful, and you can achieve the same goal with
wait_for(seconds(0)) anyway.</p>

<p><strong>You&rsquo;re a maintainer of the Boost thread library. At the same time
you develop your own library for concurrency in C++ called
<a href="http://www.stdthread.co.uk/">just::thread</a>. What is special in this library?</strong></p>

<p>Just::Thread is a strict implementation of the C++11 thread library,
highly optimized for the specific platforms targetted, whereas
Boost.Thread is aiming for portability, and doesn&rsquo;t have the same
interface or semantics in several cases. Though Boost.Thread is being
brought further in line with C++11, it still lacks std::async, which
is present in Just::Thread.</p>

<p>Just::Thread also has a special &ldquo;checked&rdquo; build which will identify
the call chain leading to a deadlock should one occur.</p>

<p><strong>Actors and the concept of sharing by communicating. It looks that the lack of this functionality doesn&rsquo;t allows the concurrency in C++11 to shine in full power. Can you recommend any libraries providing such functionality?</strong></p>

<p>The Just::thread Pro library currently in development will provide
actors. There is also an example in my book of using message queues to
create actor-style code.</p>

<p><strong>I recall your saying that multi-threading in computations is
tricky because it starts to make sense only after a certain volume. Do
you have any recommendations on when it&rsquo;s worth considering a
concurrent and multi-threaded solution, and when it isn&rsquo;t?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s an overhead to setting things up for multithreading. If
your computation is quick enough then you may well be better off
writing it single-threaded. Unless the multithreaded code is going to
be clearly faster, then writing single-threaded code will save you a
lot of headaches.</p>

<p>As ever, the key to optimizing for performance (and multithreading in
this scenario is just that &mdash; an optimization) is to profile your
application. Where is it spending its time? Can you parallelize that
section? As Jason McGuiness demonstrated in his presentation at ACCU
2012, if you parallelize the wrong part of the code then it can be a
lot of effort for no gain whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Now, TDD. Where are you in this area? Have you embraced TDD and
now use it everywhere? Is TDD applicable for developing concurrency
libraries, for example, in C++?</strong></p>

<p>I like TDD, and use it all the time. It encourages you to work in
small steps, and the test suite you build up ensures that scenarios
you&rsquo;ve tested already don&rsquo;t break as you address new scenarios.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit harder to do TDD when developing concurrency libraries, but
not impossible, and I still do it. The trick is in structuring your
test to check the right thing. You typically need some form of barrier
(I often use a std::promise with std::shared_future) so that you can
set up all your threads in the right state, and then say &ldquo;go!&rdquo; The
best way to test concurrent code is still to remove the concurrency
&mdash; have well-defined communication mechanisms, and then test each
thread in isolation.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that the code must be ideal, no trade-offs, no
tolerance to inaccuracy or lack of the beauty? How do you judge your
own code for being ready to release?</strong></p>

<p>You should always /aim/ for perfect code. If you don&rsquo;t, then it is
very easy to end up with slap-dash unmaintainable code.</p>

<p>However, you don&rsquo;t always get to write perfect code. Sometimes you
can&rsquo;t see a way to make it better, or the changes required are too
extensive for the time frame you have. It is always better to have
code that works correctly rather than code that looks pretty. If you
have extensive tests then you can refactor your code later to a better
structure without worrying about breaking it.</p>

<p>I judge code to be ready to release when I can&rsquo;t think of a
circumstance that would break it. If I can think of such a
circumstance then I write a test for that, and fix it.</p>

<p><strong>Can you name your three biggest &ldquo;Never ever do that!&rdquo; for programmers? and also for C++ programmers?</strong></p>

<p>Tricky! &ldquo;Never&rdquo; is a strong word.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some things you should rarely do, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use global variables. Pass things you need as parameters or hold
them as member variables rather than relying on globals, as globals
make access patterns hard to understand.</p></li>

<li><p>Use singletons. These are just global variables in disguise, and
should be used with the same caution.</p></li>

<li><p>Write multithreaded code without carefully thinking through the data
access patterns from the separate threads. If you&rsquo;re going to write
multithreaded code, take the time to do it properly. You&rsquo;ll save
yourself a lot of effort in the long run.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For C++ specifically, you should rarely:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use malloc and free. This is C++, not C.</p></li>

<li><p>Write code that requires you to use &ldquo;delete&rdquo;. If you have to use
&ldquo;new&rdquo; then you should probably be using a smart pointer such as
std::shared_ptr or std::unique_ptr to manage the memory. Often
you&rsquo;re better off using a container like std::vector to manage
everything anyway.</p></li>

<li><p>Overload operators in an unconventional manner. Sometimes it can be
really useful (e.g. using &lt;&lt; for stream insertion), but having a+b
mean anything other than &ldquo;adding&rdquo; for the relevant data types is
likely to yield confusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You wrote a book. Please, shed some light on this process. Why
have you decided to write it in the first place, and how long did it
take to prepare &ldquo;C++ Concurrency in Action&rdquo;? What was the most
difficult part of it?</strong></p>

<p>I wrote &ldquo;C++ Concurrency in Action&rdquo; because the opportunity came up,
and I was one of those best-placed to write it, having been intimately
involved in the drafting of the relevant sections of the C++11
standard.</p>

<p>It has taken 4 years to put it all together. One of the reasons it
took so long is because the C++11 standard wasn&rsquo;t finished when I
started writing, and I had to add, remove and revise sections as the
draft standard evolved, but even without that it was a lot of
work. The hardest part was rewriting sections based on feedback from
reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Can you recommend other books about concurrency and multi-threading?</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Patterns for Parallel Programming&rdquo; by Mattson, Sanders and Masingill
is a good overview of how to structure parallel programs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Art of Multiprocessor Programming&rdquo; by Herlihy and Shavit is also
good, but much lower level. This covers things like visibility,
atomicity and consensus, and implementation of low-level structures
such as queues, spin locks and monitors.</p>

<p><strong>Now the question I ask everybody: sport programming and
programming contests. Is it important to any developer to spend some
time regularly solving puzzles? And have you even been involved in
developing or implementing sophisticated algorithms?</strong></p>

<p>I love puzzles. To an extent, programming is one big puzzle; that&rsquo;s
what makes it interesting.</p>

<p>I think puzzles use the same sort of thought processes as programming,
so regularly doing puzzles can improve your programming. Practising
anything helps make you better, so programming puzzles and contests
are good for that &mdash; you have to break from your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; programming
routine to focus yourself on something different, and try things
out. I like the Intel Threading Challenge that they&rsquo;ve been doing for
a couple of years now. Even if you don&rsquo;t enter, it can be good to do
the challenges &mdash; they are fun, and really stretch you.</p>

<p>I did have a lot of fun once working on an algorithm for assisting
helicopter maintenance engineers tune helicopters. They take a series
of measurements from the helicopter with special equipment whilst it
is flying in a series of different conditions, and then the software
tells them what to adjust to make it fly better. Since helicopter
flights are expensive, the goal was to tune the helicopter with the
minimum possible set of test flights.</p>

<p><strong>Are you an IDE or Vi/make guy? Do you think that it is still
possible to develop sophisticated software simply in Vi, or all those
days passed and considering proper IDEs is an inevitable step in
enterprise software development?</strong></p>

<p>I use emacs and make. I haven&rsquo;t yet found an IDE that makes life
easier for me. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of potential in Eclipse/CDT,
especially with the enhancements that <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/05/19/peter-sommerlad-interview/">Peter Sommerlad</a>&rsquo;s team are adding, but I haven&rsquo;t found it enough to
switch yet.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that &ldquo;The Last Programming Language&rdquo; exists? Or may
it exist at all? Is it C++?</strong></p>

<p>There is always scope for improvement in a programming language, and
any given language makes some things easy to express and others hard,
so I&rsquo;m not sure that the &ldquo;last&rdquo; programming language could really
exist.</p>

<p>If we ever get a sufficiently advanced AI, then we&rsquo;ll end up using
natural languages rather than specific programming languages, but I
think that&rsquo;s a long way off yet.</p>

<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s talk about hiring. If you need to hire a good C++
developer, what kind of questions you&rsquo;d prefer you ask?</strong></p>

<p>To some extent that depends on what I need from a new hire. If there&rsquo;s
time to train someone then specific C++ knowledge is not an issue, and
I&rsquo;d want to focus on things that highlighted general &ldquo;developer
aptitude&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If I needed someone who already knew C++ then I&rsquo;d want to ask
questions that demonstrated that knowledge as well.</p>

<p><strong>Wrapping up, do you have a list of, say, three things which each developer must implement through his or her career?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure there are 3 things that <em>every</em> developer should
implement. However, there are definitely things to be learnt from
implementing basic data structures like lists and hash-maps, so I&rsquo;ll
take that as the first one.</p>

<p>For a second, I think a language parser can provide useful insight in
putting together data structures, even if it&rsquo;s a parser for a simple
configuration file language rather than something complicated like
C++. I think an arithmetic expression parser can be quite fun to write
as a simple exercise.</p>

<p>Finally, I think it is worthwhile writing a client-server
application. A web-app with Javascript code in the browser, and
something running on the server would work for this, but anything
where you are making calls from the client to the server over the
network will do. The point is to do something where making a server
call is considerably more expensive than making a local function
call, so you have to consider the cost when designing the API. If
there&rsquo;s a UI then it can also be an exercise in handling backend
latency whilst providing a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; UI.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks, Anthony. Looking forward for your new talks and books, hope for your future appearances on conferences.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a few months of waiting and agiotage it finally arrived. I have dived again into a wonderful world on fiddling with kernels, patches, firmware, a bit of soldering, forums and blogs, trying to explore this wonderful piece of hardware.</p>

<p>I suspect there will be series of blog posts about Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Frankly, even before receiving my own RPi I already had to solder the SD socket on another RPi which was broken. There is a rumor spreading that this type of SD sockets is very unreliable.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/raspberry-pi/arrived/IMG_0491.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>In contrast I cannot complain at all about an SD socket used in <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/">Maximite</a> but it was a different type.</p>

    <updated>2012-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/10/usb-serial-console-for-rpi-on-macosx-olimex-usb-serial-cable/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently started playing to Raspberry Pi. Along with other questions I wanted to try talking to RPi via a serial cable. The <a href="http://elinux.org/Rpi_Low-level_peripherals">documentation about RPi peripherals</a> says that at reset only pins GPIO 14 &amp; 15 (TxD, RxD) are assigned to the alternate function UART. So, it should work out of the box.</p>

<p>I decided to buy <a href="https://www.olimex.com/dev/usb-serial-cable.html">Olimex USB To Serial Cable</a>. It was available on eBay as <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Olimex-USB-SERIAL-CABLE-Olinuxino-console-cable-alternative-to-Raspberry-Pi-/280917749304?pt=UK_BOI_Electrical_Components_Supplies_ET&amp;hash=item416800ae38">Olimex USB-SERIAL-CABLE Olinuxino console cable alternative to Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<p>This cable provides 3.3V output levels which are strongly recommended for RPi (not 5V), and its 3 wires with female plugs can be directly connected to the RPi GPIO P1 header.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/olimex-cable/olimex-usb-serial-cable-olinuxino-console-cable.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at a time of this writing, there were no drivers for Mac OSX available on the <a href="https://www.olimex.com/dev/usb-serial-cable.html">official website</a>, and OSX Lion (10.7.4) didn&rsquo;t recognize this device. It was an unpleasant surprise because before I saw that Lion perfectly recognized other USB-RS232 hardware based on different chipsets (Microchip, for example).</p>

<p>I checked the Product ID and Manufacturer on the Olimex cable. When the cable is connected, click on &ldquo;About This Mac &gt; More Info… &gt; System Report… &gt; USB&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/olimex-cable/pl2303-serial-usb-on-lion.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Googling for a Prolific driver for Mac brought me to a great blog post, called &ldquo;<a href="http://xbsd.nl/2011/07/pl2303-serial-usb-on-osx-lion.html">PL2303 Serial-USB on OSX Lion</a>&rdquo;. Following the instructions I installed the driver and connected to Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>In short I did the following:</p>

<pre><code>cd /tmp
wget http://xbsd.nl/~martijn/log/osx-pl2303.kext.tgz
tar xvzf http://xbsd.nl/~martijn/log/osx-pl2303.kext.tgz
cd osx-pl2303.kext
sudo cp -R osx-pl2303.kext /System/Library/Extensions/
cd /System/Library/Extensions
chmod -R 755 osx-pl2303.kext
chown -R root:wheel osx-pl2303.kext
cd /System/Library/Extensions

kextload ./osx-pl2303.kext
kextcache -system-cache
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Just in case, I made a copy of the &ldquo;<a href="http://demin.ws/files/olimex-cable/osx-pl2303.kext.tgz">osx-pl2303.kext.tgz</a>&rdquo; file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can make sure that everything is installed correctly by:</p>

<pre><code>kextstat -b nl.bjaelectronics.driver.PL2303
</code></pre>

<p>It should print the following:</p>

<pre><code>Index Refs Address            Size       Wired      Name (Version) &lt;Linked Against&gt;
   74    0 0xffffff7f808ee000 0xb000     0xb000     nl.bjaelectronics.driver.PL2303 (1.0.0d1) &lt;73 34 5 4 3&gt;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you need to <em>unload</em> the driver for some reason, you check that the driver is loaded (by <code>kextstat</code> command above), and then:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/osx-pl2303.kext
</code></pre>

<p>When the driver is installed, reconnect the cable to USB. There should be two device drivers created <code>/dev/cu.PL2303-00002006</code> and <code>/dev/tty.PL2303-00002006</code>. You can check it by:</p>

<pre><code>ls /dev/*PL*
</code></pre>

<p>It should print:</p>

<pre><code>/dev/cu.PL2303-00002006     /dev/tty.PL2303-00002006
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s connect the cable to the RPi header P1. It&rsquo;s better to disconnect it from USB temporarily.</p>

<p>The pinout of the cable is the following:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Wire</strong></td>
<td><strong>Desc</strong></td>
<td><strong>Rip GPIO</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Blue</td>
<td>GND</td>
<td>0v</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Green</td>
<td>Rx</td>
<td>14/TxD</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Red</td>
<td>Tx</td>
<td>15/RxD</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>An example of the connection:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/olimex-cable/pl2303-serial-usb-on-lion-connected.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>When all three wires are attached, you can connect the cable back to USB. Now any terminal emulator software can talk to RPi via the <code>/dev/cu.PL2303-00002006</code> device. I used Minicom:</p>

<pre><code>minicom -D /dev/cu.PL2303-00002006 -b 115200
</code></pre>

<p>It should print something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Welcome to minicom 2.6.1

<p>Finally, you may want to re-direct the RPi console from HDMI to the serial port (ttyAMA0). In this case RPi will be printing boot messages to the serial console instead of the monitor.</p>

<p><em>You need to login to your RPi</em> (via SSH, telnet or just established serial connection) and execute the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
</code></pre>

<p>This will mount your boot partition to <code>/mnt</code>. Now you need to edit the kernel commund line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vi /mnt/cmdline.txt
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>cmdline.txt</code> make sure that <code>console=ttyAMA0,115200</code> and <code>kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200</code>, and there is no another <code>console=</code> assignment, for example to <code>tty0</code>. After you save the changes and reboot RPi, you may see RPi boot messages in the terminal emulator connected to <code>/dev/cu.PL2303-00002006</code>.</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/06/bletchley-park-colossus/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to <a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/">Bletchley Park</a> today. One hour drive was a good reason to go. During The First World War it was a top secret military base. Here Alan Turing cracked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma</a> codes, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>, the world&rsquo;s first electronic, digital, programmable computer, was built also here.</p>

<p>Now it is a museum of cryptography. Recently the Colossus was re-built, and now available to see it in action. My target was to see the Colossus and Enigma.</p>

<p>Today was a normal english day &ndash; raining all the way through. My lovely big brolly was incredibly useful.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0508.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>If to skip a sticker on the windows, you may think that The War is still on.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0492.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Illustrations in the past were always created with love to details and general beauty.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0494.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>A revolver. Just caught my eye because it was so close.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0495.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Frankly, I saw MP 38 (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP-36">Schmeisser</a>) so close first time in my life.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0496.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Do you recognized this tool? A twisted-pair crimp tool? This was from the 40th.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0498.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Looks like a key disc from Enigma-like machine.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0499.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>In fact, the Enigma. To be exact &ndash; a bunch of them. I imagined the Enigma as a particular device which I saw in the American re-make of the &ldquo;Das Boot&rdquo; movie. But looks that even lazy people manufactured it.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0501.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>A crypto device from Siemens.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0502.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Now a portable modification.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0503.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>All exhibits are real and more than 70 years old.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0504.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">Bombe</a> machine which was build particularly to crack the Enigma code.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0505.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The back view.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0506.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>In action.</p>

<p>In a radio cabin.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0509.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>On the way to The Colossus.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0510.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>So, this is it &ndash; the top secret computer of the British secret service during the First World War. Recently it was re-built and now available in action.</p>

<p>This is a two panels stuffed with bulbs. The front panel, from the left.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0512.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The front panel, from the right.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0513.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The back view. It is all moving and cracking. The modern fans on the floor are cooling the bulbs.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0514.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The back view from the left.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0515.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Between the panels. The oscilloscope even displays some figures.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0516.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>How Colossus worked.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0518.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Frankly, it wasn&rsquo;t impressed at all. Yes, it is moving and cracking by tapes and spins, but&hellip; May be if they allow to code up a little program in place, I was much more excited.</p>

<p>In the same building with the Colossus, there is a <a href="http://www.tnmoc.org/">The National Museum of Computing</a>. Today it was, a shame, closed. Trying to bribe a person on duty to allow me to pop into mainframe and PC rooms did work out.</p>

<p>There is only a sad picture through the bars.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bletchley-park/IMG_0511.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>And this is the must have thing for any respectable bookstore (this is in the gift shop where they mostly sell books about the history of cryptography) &ndash; a sofa.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/04/gmc-4/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/04/gmc-4/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a <a href="http://ramlamyammambam.livejournal.com/190698.html">recommendation from Serge Vakulenko</a> I have purchased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC-4">GMC-4</a> in a funny Japanese gadget stop, <a href="http://www.japantrendshop.com/gmc4-microcomputer-p-789.html">Japan Trend Shop</a>. To be honest, there is unique charm in such devices.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/gmc4.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>GMC-4 is a 4-bit microcomputer:</p>

<ul>
<li>4-bit word</li>
<li>8 register, 1 flag</li>
<li>80 words in program memory</li>
<li>16 words in data memory</li>
<li>7 pre-loaded program (Organ, Sound Hit Game, Whack-a-mole, Tennis, Timer, Music Player, Morse Code Generator)</li>
<li>7 regular 2-pin LEDs</li>
<li>one 7-segment LED</li>
<li>a hex keypad</li>
<li>a speaker</li>
<li>hard reset button</li>
<li>powered from three AA elements</li>
</ul>

<p>The architecture is described in one small document &ndash; <a href="http://tsoj.manga.org/gakken/otona_gmc.html">Programming the Gakken GMC-4 Microcomputer</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday my order arrived. GMC-4 is an add-on to an issue of a Japanese magazine called &ldquo;Gakken&rdquo;, #24, 2009. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s all in Japanese language.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0458.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Funny that the back side of the box has a table of all GMC-4 instructions.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0459.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The board, speaker, case, parts of the keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0460.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The manual in Japanese is though.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0469.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Set up batteries and the speaker.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0463.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The board.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0461.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0462.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Sticking the keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0464.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0466.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Power on&hellip; It&rsquo;s alive! Alive!!!</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/gmc4/IMG_0468.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>There is the keyboard, the 7-segment LED, the processor below it, then the &ldquo;hard reset&rdquo; button. There are seven independent LEDS on the top. They are used, for instance, to display the current address.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write something. For example, a program waiting for a key pressed and then displaying it on the 7-segment readout.</p>

<pre><code>00: 0     KA 0       ; Read a key code (0-F) into A. If pressed, then Flag=0, else Flag=1.
01: F00   JUMP 00    ; If Flag=1 (not pressed), then go to 00.   
04: 1     AO         ; Out A to 7-segment readout and set Flag=1
05: F00   JUMP 00    ; If Flag=1 (it is always 1 here), then jump to 00.
</code></pre>

<p>To enter the code: <code>RESET 0 INCR F INCR 0 INCR 0 INCR 1 INCR F INCR 0 INCR 0 INCR RESET</code></p>

<p>To run: <code>RESET 1 RUN</code></p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/t-S86rICAPk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Interestingly, this device allows <strong>step-by-step trace</strong>. If to run the program via <code>RESET 6 RUN</code>, it will be stopping after each instruction and displaying the current address on the top LEDs in binary code. To continue, we need to press <code>INCR</code> and so on. By pressing <code>RESET</code> we can interrupt the program and check out the registers (they are regular cells in memory). This is simple but convenient debugging.</p>

<p>Now slightly more complex example: a running light over the top LEDs displaying the number of the current one on the 7-segment readout.</p>

<pre><code>00: 80    TIA 0     ; A=0
02: 1     AO        ; Out A to 7-segment readout.
03: 3     CY        ; Store A to Y.
04: E1    CAL SETR  ; Turn on an LED which number is in Y.
06: 84    TIA 4     ; A=4
08: EC    CAL TMR   ; Wait (A+1)*0.1 seconds (0.5s).
0A: E2    CAL RSTR  ; Turn off an LED which number is in Y.
0C: 3     CY        ; Restore A from Y.
0D: 91    AIA 1     ; A = A + 1
0F: C7    CIA 7     ; If A=7, then Flag=0. Otherwise Flag=1.
11: F02   JUMP 02   ; Go to 02, if Flag=1, and set Flag=1.
13: F00   JUMP 00   ; Unconditional jump to 00 (Flag=1 after the previous instruction).
</code></pre>

<p>Code: <code>8 0 1 3 E 1 8 4 E C E 2 3 9 1 C 7 F 0 2 F 0 0</code></p>

<h1>Wrap up</h1>

<p>This is an amazing gadget. I started programming on <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">Radio-86RK</a> in machine code typing in the Monitor. Same here. Also, the issue of the magazine, which GMC-4 is bundled with, according to illustrations (unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t read Japanese), is dedicated to the history of microprocessors starting from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel 4004</a>. Then there is a dozen of code examples and projects using GMC-4. Beautiful!</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/03/can-java-be-faster-cpp/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/07/03/can-java-be-faster-cpp/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have a friend, <a href="http://stas-blogspot.blogspot.com/">Stas</a>. As true programmers we periodically argue on a million dollar question: what is faster, C++ (me) or Java (he), especially along with having various amounts of various drinks. Undoubtedly, not the technology, a social part of such disputes is the main one. But sometimes, sober-headed, when I think about such comparison, I cannot convince even myself that Java can work faster or at least with the same speed as C++.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume that:</p>

<ul>
<li>We compare C++ 2011 generating native code and vanilla Java 7 generating JVM code. The JVM code will be compiled into machine code by the JIT compiler later on at runtime when the code is executed first time.</li>
<li>Suppose, both C++ and Java compilers generate the most effective code as language semantics in a maximum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Denote <code>A</code> to be the linear machine code execution speed, <code>B</code> &ndash; the speed of compiling bytecode into  machine code. So, the overall execution speed is:</p>

<pre><code>V(C++) = A1 + B1
V(Java) = A2 + B2
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, <code>B1 = 0</code>, because C++ generates native code and doesn&rsquo;t require extra work at all at runtime. But <code>B2</code> is <em>always</em> greater than zero by definition. Regardless how effective the JIT compiler is, it <em>always</em> requires some time to compile bytecode into native code. Furthermore, it doesn&rsquo;t compile all at once. It compiles &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; when the code is actually executed. There is always a non-zero probability that the program execution flow may be paused by the JIT compiler. Even we assume that the JIT compiler uses sophisticated code prediction algorithms to reduce <code>B2</code> as much as possible, it cannot eliminate <code>B2</code> completely.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s have a look at <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>. These parameters define how fast the generated code is. In my personal, totally subjective and biased view, C++ (not C) has more chances for better optimization because of the templates (the compiler has full language semantics to inline) and the native machine code generation (the compiler can use the most effective machine instructions in each situation). Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m not an expert in Java generics. I have just heard that they are not &ldquo;native&rdquo; citizens in Java. Also the Java compiler has to generate portable bytecode and cannot optimize on each particular platform. I hope, the JIT compiler tries to optimize it at runtime but there is no semantics information available anymore. Then the JIT compiler faces the trade-off between the speed and quality of compilation. C++ doesn&rsquo;t have this problem because the compilation phase can be as long as necessary.</p>

<p>Well, I cannot convince even myself that Java can be faster than C++. I&rsquo;d like to, but I have no arguments.</p>

<p>With Stas we did a few straightforward benchmarks based on QuickSort. Java worked ~10% slower on average.</p>

<p>Prior to C++ 2011 we could say that C++ had no a well-defined memory model and a standard library for concurrency. It might allow Java to beat C++ using multi-threading and concurrency. But now C++ has these features. In general either C++ or Java provide pretty low-level API for concurrency comparing, for instance, to goroutines in Go or actors in Scala (though <code>std::async()</code> is quite powerful feature now in C++).</p>

<p>Agreed, 10% don&rsquo;t always play the key role. Sometimes, advanced mechanisms of introspection, IDEs, managed execution, code hot swapping, etc. &ndash; in fact, everything what the Java <em>platform</em> provides, are more important than just byte threshing. But there is nothing about speed, right?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seems that homemade microcomputers are coming back. I already wrote about <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/">Maximite</a>.</p>

<p>Lately I had an opportunity to play with a few devices of such sort, but slightly upper class based on ARM, not PIC32.</p>

<p>I apologize at once for quality of pictures, but I didn&rsquo;t manage properly taking pictures of the bright computer screen neither on iPhone nor on a camera.</p>

<h1>MK802 (aka Mini Android 4.0)</h1>

<p>This is a device I have bought. It costs 70$ + delivery. There is another, more modern 1GB model already available on the <a href="https://www.miniand.com">official website</a>. Mine has 512MB only.</p>

<p>My photos:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0362.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0363.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0364.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The USB #1. The device can be powered via this socket but they say it needs at least two amps, so powering from a regular computer may not work. I connected a keyboard here.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0366.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Mini HDMI. I also managed to connect to a DVI monitor via an adapter.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0368.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>At the end face there is another USB port and an external power connector.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0369.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Micro-SD. The case of the device as a whole is a just bit bigger than a regular USB stick.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0371.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Connected to TV. Android is built-in. Booting time to this splash-screen is ~5s.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0372.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Time of the full boot is ~25s.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0374.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Connected a mouse, somehow entered a WiFi password in the virtual keyboard and checked out the proper website.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0379.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The desktop is optimized as a media center, that&rsquo;s why everything is so big on the screen. After some fiddling with fonts, I had got this:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0386.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Now another proper website.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0380.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Internal storage characteristics.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0383.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>The version of Android.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0384.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Pre-installed applications.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0385.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Finally, yet another proper website. Unfortunately, JSLinux wasn&rsquo;t able to boot up fully. Maybe because of the web browser.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/mk802/IMG_0387.JPG" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Built-in Android doesn&rsquo;t require a flash card. If to prepare a card with another Linux, MK802 will boot from it. I have tried images of Ubuntu 12.04 and Lubuntu from the official website. Alas, it worked very slow and unresponsive. MK802 does require a proper distro optimized specifically for this platform.</p>

<p>On the <a href="https://www.miniand.com/forums/forums/2/topics/1">official forum</a> there are more photos of MK802. Also there are <a href="https://www.miniand.com/forums/forums/2/topics/19">disassembly slides</a> of a slightly different model.</p>

<p>Conclusion: It is not quite clear who is the audience of this device. Even Maximite allows to play with hardware, but here&hellip; Maybe running <a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a> as a media center might have at least little sense.</p>

<h1>CuBox</h1>

<p>Produced <a href="http://solid-run.com/">SolidRun</a>. The device was purchased by one of my colleagues, annoyed waiting his Raspberry PI (I&rsquo;m also still waiting mine), and I was able to play with it.</p>

<p>CPU is slower, but the <a href="http://solid-run.com/products/cubox">peripherals</a> are much more advanced (no WiFi, though), and they also promise 1080p video. So CuBox is more likely to be a media center.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a proper cube, which side is roughly as a match box.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/cubox/image_0.jpeg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Power, Ethernet, HDMI, Micro-SD, USBx2, eSATA.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/cubox/image_1.jpeg" alt="" />

<p>Frankly, the device looks being made in someone&rsquo;s kitchen. On the second picture it&rsquo;s clearly visible that the connectors are not quite aligned with the case. But the device in general works fine. It has Ubuntu 10.04 pre-installed.</p>

<h1>Raspberry PI</h1>

<p>This board was given to me by another colleague of mine who had eventually got it. It came as is, without a power supply and a flash card to boot from. You have to prepare everything by yourself. Fortunately, plenty of stuff is available online.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/mini-computers/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>What does make PI different from MK802 and CuBox is general purpose ports (GPIO) (in the top left corner). Theoretically you can plug in your own homemade devices into Raspberry PI. PI was developed as an educational device, not an end user one.</p>

<h1>Instead of the conclusion</h1>

<p>The market of tiny computers is exploding. They grow as mushrooms after the rain. ARM is great, apart from one little issue &ndash; Chrome isn&rsquo;t yet available on it due to obvious reasons.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Problem: given a container, in which we have to find arbitrary elements and delete them. If to skip initial requirements, its alternative implementations,  or example, using an extra index to avoid linear search time, and to focus on our implementation only, it turns to a question: is it faster to search with O(N) in lists and delete with O(1), or to index an element with O(1) in the vector and delete with O(N). Intuition says that the vector may beat them all (bunk shifts of data in the vector looks more suitable for an optimization rather than a traversal over the list), but I wanted some numbers.</p>

<p>A quote from the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe anything really revolutionary has ever been invented by committee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Huh!? Only for the sake of this quote this book is worth to be read.</p>

<p><a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/12/27/steve-jobs-the-exclusive-biography/">Steve Jobs biography</a> was interesting reading, even quite long though. Steve Wozniak&rsquo;s book is much shorter, and also closer to people with engineering background.</p>

<p>Steve Wozniak tells a story how it all happened. How he spent nights at school time designing, re-designing, then again and again re-designing non-existent yet computers just on paper. It helped him develop a unique habit to always use a minimum number of chips in his circuit designs. A perfect example is a first floppy disk controller for the Apple 2 computer. Instead of a complicated and costly purely hardware solution he put a few chips and then implemented the rest in 6502 assembly language, having masterly fulfilled requirements for signal timings. Additionally, he designed, again using a few chips, a state machine, which he programmed directly in 4-bit machines codes also designed by himself (a handmade programmable logic matrix approach). Eventually, at some day Steve had invented the Apple 2, a revolutionary personal computer with the color TV-display and the full keyboard. By the way, contrary to the ordinary opinion, Jobs didn&rsquo;t participate in its development. In a few years that computer made both Steves multi millionaires and started the Apple Computers. It is no wonder that the Apple surpassed everybody on the market &ndash; it was simpler, cheaper and have a bunch of unique features.</p>

<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t the end of the story. After Steve got into a plan crash on a small airplane, operating himself, and after that incident he was suffering from partial amnesia for some time. Then he quit Apple, and, again, contrary to the ordinary opinion, he wasn&rsquo;t fired, suspended or something because they all had quarreled. He just wanted to start another project &ndash; a universal remote control for consumer electronics. Formally, till now Steve is still an Apple employee, even with a salary.</p>

<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t also the end of the story. For some reason Steve decided to organize an open air rock gig, a festival, similar to Woodstock. In fact, he did a few of them. Of course, the technology was involved. These festivals had a live satellite connection to USSR (they used equipment installed for the Olympic games in Moscow in the eightieth), right through the &ldquo;iron curtain&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After that Steve taught bases of computers at school for more than ten years and was engaged in philanthropy.</p>

<p>The whole slice of the book is also devoted to pranks Steve have been constantly doing through his life. For example, a Dial-A-Joke service he ran in his own apartment, or a portable TV jammer, and that big one, &ldquo;The Zaltair Prank&rdquo;, when Steve spread a rumor about a competing computer company, called Zaltair (remember The Altair which launched Bill Gates to the orbit?). Even Jobs believed it and only after years realised that it was a setup.</p>

<p>So, if you have at least a little interest in biographies, it is worth to read this engaging story about the good fellow, genius engineer, who transformed the industry of personal computers once and for all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everybody loves inventing patterns. Noticed a situation? Realised that it happens not only for you? This is a pattern!</p>

<p>Seems I also have invented a pattern called &ldquo;The biased attitude to your own product&rdquo;. Here is a typical stream of thoughts when preparing a product release: &ldquo;Oh, a little glitch here, a tiny typo there, this could be done better, that should be refactored&rdquo;, etc. But when you open up a nicely packaged someone else&rsquo;s product you think &ldquo;Oh, man, how great and nicely polished it looks!&rdquo;. But, of course, that &ldquo;someone else&rdquo; went through exactly the same thoughts &ldquo;polishing&rdquo; that product.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m regularly involved in producing releases, sorting bug reports, postmortem analysis, etc. I usually follow this kind of strategy: The sales grow? Yes. A number of customer issues decreases? Yes. A number of internal defects decreases? Yes. The conclusion: everything is fine, and we&rsquo;re doing great. The rest is just a normal development process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you have a class where you believe you need to write a copy constructor and copy-assignment operator you are doing something wrong. // <strong>Peter Sommerlad</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Today my guest is <a href="http://wiki.hsr.ch/PeterSommerlad">Peter Sommerlad</a>. I was lucky to attend his sessions at the ACCU 2012 conference recently. Peter is a C++ veteran and a contributor to the C++ standard. He is a professor at HSR Rapperswil, Switzerland, and director of IFS Institute for Software (http://ifs.hsr.ch). With a team of assistants and students he develops various tools and frameworks for C++ and other languages based on Eclipse.</p>

<p>Now we&rsquo;ll have a chance to ask Peter a few questions, which could hide behind his talks and presentations but still be very interesting for the readers.</p>

<h3>Hi Peter, thanks for the interview. I won&rsquo;t be original here, but I cannot skip this question. What happened in the past that you turned to computers and become a programmer? Please, tell us your story.</h3>

<p>I was very good at maths in school and in the last year I could take an additional course that included programming a programmable calculator, a HP 33 which had a stack for operands. In contrast to some of my friends who had a Casio, a TI-59 or even a Commodore V(I)C 20 home computer, I had not yet any idea of programming. However, with some explanations by our teacher I was able to &ldquo;port&rdquo; a TI-59 register-based lunar lander I found in a magazine to the HP 33 provided by the school. Once I got the hang of it, I &ldquo;invented&rdquo; a simple game: a ballistic shooting game. Goal was to hit a target at a random distance that was obstructed by a random generated wall in between. Something like Angry Birds but in in 1982 on a pocket calculator with a 10 digit seven segment LED display. You needed a lot of imagination to understand the game. You input 2 numbers: angle and velocity and the program would tell you if you hit the wall or by what distance you missed the goal. That was the first program I remember to have written myself.</p>

<p>That course on programming the HP 33, and the suggestion by my older sister who knew someone studying &ldquo;Informatik&rdquo; who earned good money while still a student made me drop my plans to sign up for a maths major and start out to study computer science (named Informatik in German) in Frankfurt/Main. Before I started university I got my first &ldquo;real but home-&rdquo; computer, a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, with enormous 48kBytes and cassette tape mass storage. That meant programming in BASIC where according to our maths teacher the &ldquo;computer will assign the memory automatically to the named variables and you no longer needed to remember what you placed into register R1 and R2&rdquo;. One of the first programs on my ZX Spectrum was drawing a red heart shape on the screen (yes, filling irregular shapes was a big problem then). I showed that my then girlfriend, but I am not sure she really appreciated that, since the computer got sometimes a bit more attention than she. I remember that, because from time to time I get reminded by her of that episode (we are now married for more than 20 years :-).</p>

<p>Then came university time and I had to learn assembly programming in the first semester on a Univac 1100. After the lecture on indirect addressing, one of my mates and me wrote a 2 statement program that created an endless indirect load to itself. Running it caused a &ldquo;watchdog error&rdquo; to occur after 2 seconds of CPU time (which was much on a mainframe then and meant all other programs were suspended for 2 seconds). After starting the program about 3 times, a guy from the operating team bursted into the computer room and shouted who was the one with our account. We slowly raised our hands and he took us to his office. After asking what we were doing and our explanation, he told us that he learned something. We had to promise never to run that program again and also never to tell that to our fellow students and got away with it. In the second semester came Pascal and now &ldquo;real&rdquo; programs. Pointers (in Pascal) were the first hurdle, because they were introduced without any application or motivation, such as a linked list. Only after that I was able to grok them. Some semesters later I started a job as a programmer in a small programming shop run by older fellow students. There I could actually apply my learning and got a lot of practice in solving real problems in a variety of languages, like dBaseII, Dataflex, UCSD Pascal, and Microsoft Pascal. For example, I implemented a B*-index based &ldquo;data base&rdquo; framework in Microsoft Pascal running on DOS.</p>

<p>I guess a very great impact was access to UNIX source code, especially the tools like make, awk, etc, during my diploma thesis project. I wrote a Modula-2 front end in C with lex and yacc. To be able to work at home, I had to port all the tools I needed on my 16 bit DOS computer. That required to understand the code&rsquo;s inner working and structure and thus I learned from Dennis Ritchie and his colleagues a lot. It grew my taste for simple and elegant code.</p>

<h3>Do you remember that &ldquo;First Book&rdquo; you read about computers and programming? And also what is your the most influential book across the entire career?</h3>

<p>One of the first books on programming that I remember was Jensen/Wirth &ldquo;Pascal User Manual and Report&rdquo; and then Wirth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Algorithms and Data Structures = Programs&rdquo;. However, the latter contained many bugs when the code was blindly typed in, for example, in the version I got, merge sort was not stable, so in principle that is a stable sorting algorithm.</p>

<p>However, there are so many books that influenced my thinking about programming it is hard for me to pick just one. But I can pick one that I co-authored: Pattern-oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns aka POSA1. First, while writing it I learned so much about software, architecture and teams. As well after publishing and while presenting parts of its material on conferences I met so many influencing people who clearly shaped me heavily. Some of them I call friends today.</p>

<h3>I was excited about your saying at the ACCU, that before using some cool and sexy features of C++, I must be given a C++ driving license by you. I had found this idea to be very useful and practical for teaching C++ and also setting up company coding standards. But how do you split the language to &ldquo;allowed and recommended to everybody&rdquo; features and &ldquo;off-license&rdquo; ones?</h3>

<p>That is a tough question to answer. I was referring to C++11 and many language features that people learned in the past are no longer that relevant for non-library programmers. But I&rsquo;d like to give you an example.</p>

<p>Stroustrup&rsquo;s &ldquo;The C++ Programming Language&rdquo; introduces a class Vector that manages its memory by a pointer as one of the examples for building classes. Writing such a class in a correct, exception safe way is very hard and even C++ experts make mistakes. A reader of that book might be tempted to build his own vector or string class (women are typically not that way) which is first wrong and second completely unnecessary. If put in his first project&rsquo;s code and used throughout it also introduces a maintenance burden in the long run.</p>

<p>It is something like the situation with Wirth&rsquo;s algorithms and data structures. &ldquo;All&rdquo; students who had a hard time learning that will program a linked list as the first thing in their first job, because they will &ldquo;need&rdquo; it anyway. While that might have been true in C, we now have much better data structures in libraries that belong to our languages (not only C++). I could start ranting about the Java library&rsquo;s quality, but I leave that to my colleague who is teaching algorithms and data structures in Java at our university.</p>

<p>Now, after we learned what not to do, I recommend to use C++&rsquo;s standard library, especially the algorithms, because loops is also what you learned and what is encapsulated there. With C++11 we no longer have to do resource management by hand, but we can use std::vector, std::string, std::shared_ptr/std::unique_ptr, etc, which will do all resource management for us and allows the compiler generated default constructors and destructors to be correct automatically. When you have a class where you believe you need to write a copy constructor and copy-assignment operator you are doing something wrong. With boost this is almost also always true in C++03.</p>

<p>To sum up, unless you have acquired a deep understanding on library implementation practices, use libraries instead of inventing your own. Even then, avoid unnecessary DIY resource management. After myself learning more and more about how hard it is to implement the standard library components correctly and portable, I greatly appreciate those who have the experience and patience to do so. That is actually close to rocket science. But typical problems to be solved by C++ do not require that, when you use the standard library and other libraries provided by theses rocket scientists. But remember, we are on the edge of tourist space travel.</p>

<h3>You contributed to the C++ 2011 standard. What were you involved to?</h3>

<p>Not much, because I was late in the game. However, I managed to obtain funding from our school thanks to our headmaster Prof. Hermann Mettler to host the C++ standardization committee meeting in Rapperswil in August 2010. Some sentences in the section about std::async have been (re-)written by me with the support from many others in the committee and some other mostly editorial corrections. However, while writing my book on Simple C++ I often have to refer to the standard document and find minor mistakes regularly that will influence a future version when fixed by the editor.</p>

<h3>Is there something in C++ 2011 which you really hate?</h3>

<p>How do you define hate? I can accept the standard like it is, because I know how it is actually produced. All the deficits that might annoy me are a target for fixing and working on the next version of the standard and I can work on that to do so. Sometimes you also have to accept the compromises the committee has to come up with.</p>

<p>If I would have been involved earlier and one of the features I championed would have been forcefully put down by my fellows I might be upset. May be, after thinking about that, I do not like that const is consistently put to the left, where logic tells me it should be put to the right. Both versions are syntactically allowed. I asked some people, if I should submit a paper to change that for a future version I was more or less forcefully held back by the elders.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s talk about TDD. I know you developed a unit testing framework called CUTE. I believe, you did have some major reasons developing your own library. Why CUTE? Which interesting features does it provide?</h3>

<p>First, it is header only and thus gives no hurdle such as linking to start with, especially for my students. I wrote an article on why I wrote it and it was published in an <a href="http://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/Overload75.pdf">ACCU Overload magazine #75</a> (a slightly update version is available on <a href="http://wiki.hsr.ch/PeterSommerlad/wiki.cgi?CuTe">http://wiki.hsr.ch/PeterSommerlad/wiki.cgi?CuTe</a>). Main reason was that I was disappointed by CppUnit and also by another unit testing framework that I myself wrote for my work in the 1990s. Inspired by Kevlin Henney I tried to utilize the standard library and minimize the use of macros, even though, this meant, tests must be registered &ldquo;manually&rdquo; and aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;automagically&rdquo; registered by static initializers (that GoogleTest will employ in its macros). I wanted to avoid relying on static initializers, because I have been bitten by them in the past with shared libraries and their inter-dependencies. The burden of test registration is mitigated by our CUTE Eclipse CDT plug-in (http://cute-test.com). The plug-in will generate the test registration code for you and even analyses if you forgot to register a test function and provides a quick fix doing so. Also nice is the diff viewer for failed ASSERT_EQUAL() checks, but that requires your values to be streamable on a std::ostream&amp;. That provides a slight hurdle for embedded developers who want to run the testing framework on an embedded target, because of the sometimes prohibitive size of the iostream code. However, I plan to release a version of CUTE later this year that allows to configure if diff output should be provided or not, enabling a run on an embedded target that doesn&rsquo;t allow iostreams.</p>

<p>Two of my students implemented the first TDD support for Eclipse CDT and it was productized by one of my assistants as part of our CUTE plug-in (http://cute-test.com). The TDD support will automatically generate variable definitions from using an unknown variable in code. It will furthermore generate class or enum types from using an unknown type in a declaration and it will also create (member-) function definition frames from calling an unknown function. This is very handy when either writing code in a test-driven or top-down design style. Soon the CUTE plug-in will integrate another student&rsquo;s work: Mockator. Mockator generates code and build-system settings within Eclipse CDT to enable dependency injection in existing C and C++ code by so-called seams. Seams were introduced by Michael Feathers in his great book &ldquo;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&rdquo;. Based on these seams, Mockator can also generate test stubs and mocks for functions and types. You can read more about Mockator and its features in <a href="http://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/overload108.pdf">ACCU&rsquo;s Overload magazine 108</a>.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;IDE vs Vi&rdquo; holy war. I know you actively use and enhance Eclipse CDT for easier unit testing and refactoring. Do you think that IDEs are the only future because of massively growing complexity of software over the years? or it is still possible just using Vi and &ldquo;make&rdquo; efficiently and quickly develop sophisticated software?</h3>

<p>I know vi since about 1985. I still use it regularly to create simple files, like one-off shell scripts. I love it for being available everywhere.</p>

<p>However, for serious programming a good IDE is today the tool of the trade. It is like using a powerful car compared to a children tricycle to travel hundreds of miles. Yes, there are people who are fast on a tricycle, however, a car is much more comfortable. May be a car is a bad metaphor and an agile helicopter would be better, since a good IDE such as Eclipse CDT allows to quickly navigate code that it is very easy to understand an existing code base even if it is huge. Definitions and declarations are a mouse hover or a click away and the IDE usually keeps track where you come from, so you can easily get back. Any Java programmer who has used an IDE like Eclipse intensively will only consider programming in another language if similar IDE features are available. We are working hard to make Eclipse CDT at least as good for C++ than it is for Java. That is hard work and any financial sponsorship to our institute is welcome.</p>

<h3>Do you believe that sport programming and programming contests should be a mandatory discipline for any student reading computer science?</h3>

<p>In our university&rsquo;s program we ask our students to perform a lot of lab exercises in programming. Also at least 3-4 major one term development projects are part of the bachelor degree. Doing lab exercises in a fun way can help students learn. For example, I often give exercises in C++ to solve a problem without explicit loops or recursion, only STL algorithms are allowed. A loop solution might be obvious, but figuring out a more elegant algorithm call helps a lot.</p>

<p>However, some contests are set up in a way that only speed is important and not the long term effects of clean code. That is one of the reasons I either provide or ask for unit tests in my lab exercises. I even provide unit tests in exams for code to be written by the students.</p>

<h3>We usually learn by examples. Can you recommend where a beginner can look at the examples of very good modern code?</h3>

<p>Such examples for C++11 are hard to find, since compilers aren&rsquo;t around so long. In addition, many current C++11 example code is used to demonstrate the new features such as move semantics without really having a use case that is benefiting from that. I&rsquo;ll try in my upcoming book to give good examples. Be aware, many C++ standard library implementations are much more complex than code you want to look at, because they have to cope with strange environments (macros), provide backward compatibility and need to compensate for compiler (version) deficiencies. Solving these problems are not typical for a beginner and give a wrong impression on how to write your own code. I&rsquo;ll try to lead by example, but even CUTE has some warts, because I wanted to support C++03 with boost, std::tr1 and C++11.</p>

<h3>What is the software development for you: craft or art? Do you think that good software must have beauty sources? Or if the requirements are satisfied, the tests passed, the coding standard is complied &ndash; the job is done, no art or beauty &ndash; just the result.</h3>

<p>Software creation is art but also a craft. It requires thorough learning and practice to master. Most of art always requires also craft. They can not be separated.</p>

<p>I believe in code beauty. But that is relative, what is often good for beginners often suffers from the expert&rsquo;s elegance. Knowing the tools available to you is essential to master them. Only knowing std::vector, for example, but not the STL&rsquo;s algorithms will provide you working code, but not elegance, even if that is only counted by a function&rsquo;s McCabe complexity (by the way another C++ CDT plug-in currently developed by students).</p>

<p>We were the first ones after Bill Opdyke to try to implement C++ refactoring. We co-created large parts of CDT&rsquo;s internals to support refactoring and code generation based on ASTs (abstract syntax tree). So running the tests is not enough, code must be cleanly refactored. I do a lot of code reviews, and I often see chances to simplify it. But I doubt that talent can be automated, it is a mixture of taste and experience. It requires not only seeing the smells but also their removal. On the other hand, if you look at Martin Fowler&rsquo;s smells and refactorings they often come in contrasting pairs.</p>

<p>Some coding standards even promote what I consider bad practice and introduce unnecessary complexity. For example, Google suggests that &ldquo;out&rdquo;-parameters for functions should be implemented as pointers, even in C++. The motivation behind that is, that at the call site one would need to write foo(&amp;var) to pass the address of the variable deliberately. This is thought to improve code readability. However, while necessary in C due to the lack of references, this guideline just imposes C problems solved by C++ references onto C++ code. Within such a function, one must check that the passed in pointer is not nullptr (to use a C++11 term) and one never can be sure it is actually valid if the caller made a mistake, or one could ignore the problem at all and crash when a user passes nullptr. A C++ solution should declare the function to take a reference instead, like void foo(type &amp; var); and an IDE will show that when you hover on the call site, without the additional need of marking it in the code by an ampersand. Using the language features effectively to write less and simpler code should be the guideline and not the protection of programmers sticking with legacy editors and not knowing their tool.</p>

<p>A coding standard or any rule is only good if it can actually be enforced. Tools like (PC-)lint help to do that. Often such classic tools are command-line and build-process based. More modern versions are integrated in an IDE and provide not only analysis but also quick-fixes for the found problems, for example, FindBugs for Java or FXCop for C#. Configuring them to avoid false positives without missing real problems is always an effort. To ease the application and use of lint, we created Linticator an Eclipse CDT plug-in that will automatically configure lint and run it and visualize its results within the IDE (http://linticator.com).</p>

<h3>Can you name three the biggest &ldquo;no-no&rdquo; for programmers in any area?</h3>

<p>Being too self confident, instead do write (Unit) Tests and run them regularly. Any current software without automated tests is unprofessional in my view.</p>

<p>Lack of architecture or architectural knowledge is one of the big problems I often encounter when doing code reviews. This is often fostered by lack of understanding of good design.</p>

<p>A simple last thing: global variables also in the disguise as singletons. Pass in all dependencies from the outside as arguments. This will also show you, where you have too much coupling. Know the patterns to deal with that and writing unit tests helps you to avoid that early.</p>

<h3>Which programming language would you recommend as a very first one for beginners?</h3>

<p>There are so many to choose from. I do not want to recommend one, because each will have its deficits. It is more important to learn more than one and those with different paradigms such as functional, object oriented, dynamically typed, statically typed, compiled, interpreted, virtual machine-based or machine language translated. An old saying is &ldquo;you can write FORTRAN code in any language&rdquo;. This should not be done with multiple languages, but you need to learn and apply the language&rsquo;s idioms consciously.</p>

<h3>Today there are plenty of educational resources available online. You can even be officially graded online. Do you believe that on-site education is still important?</h3>

<p>Yes. Interaction with students is so important. It is not only them getting feedback, but it also allows me to learn from them and improve my teaching. Both kinds of feedback are important and are more efficient when immediately. A remote learning environment can not provide that bi-directional feedback, but it can be a great help for those who can not be there for some reasons. But I believe it is very expensive to provide a good remote learning environment.</p>

<h3>In the martial arts they have the concept of schools, or styles, and they compete trying to prove the excellence. Is there something similar to the software development?</h3>

<p>I know of people to use martial arts metaphors, such as coding dojos. I have no idea about martial arts, the only sport I like, except regular cardio-vascular exercise, is skiing. This is not a team sport but allows me to get into flow and forget everything. Intensive work can be like that. But software is a team sport and regular exercises of standard moves, aka, code katas can help to shape your subconsciousness in taste for good code and style, but only if you either have that already or get the feedback to develop that. A problem I see is, that many teachers of programming novices lack the (current) practical experience of programming (including myself, but at least I try to be exposed to code regularly).</p>

<h3>Hiring. If you need to hire a good C++ developer, how would you do that? The language is very complicated, so how would you asses a good developer?</h3>

<p>I always have asked for code examples written by the person. Once I declined a very good PhD for exactly the reason that his code was badly written and &ldquo;smelly&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Today, also the willingness to adapt to change and architectural taste is important. A candidate must understand Patterns and must know there are more than 23 GOF patterns. And better even understand that some of them like Singleton are better not employed in a software&rsquo;s design.</p>

<h3>Well, wrapping up. The final question: do you think in software development that we choose our profession, or the profession chooses us?</h3>

<p>I started out by choosing my university subject. However, the great thing about software is that we are able to invent and create our own tools. It is like if a baker would be able to create a new oven or dough mixer by baking it. So after learning a bit of it, I actually got chosen by my profession. I am doing it for about 30 years now, teaching it for about 25 years (I started teaching programming while still university student), writing articles and books about it since about 18 years and still love doing all that. I have as my goal to make this world a better world for programmers and thus hope to rid our world from bad software. I understand that I will not achieve that, but it gives me a lot of direction.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Peter for you time. Looking forward for your new software and talks.</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So often in code reviews I see something like this:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;string&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;cstdio&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string s <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;12345678&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span><span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;[%s]</span><span class="hl esc">\n</span><span class="hl str">&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> s<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This is an obvious typo of missing <code>s.c_str()</code> instead of just <code>s</code>. Weirdly, Visual Studio doesn&rsquo;t warn you even with <code>/Wall</code>. More over, the code works!. But <code>gcc</code> warns though:</p>

<pre><code>warning: cannot pass objects of non-POD type 'struct std::string' through '...'; call will abort at runtime
</code></pre>

<p>and the program dies with <code>Illegal instruction</code>.</p>

<p>Did they really implement a trick in STL to make programs having such  typo working just because this typo is very common?</p>

    <updated>2012-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/05/17/veracity/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read about &ldquo;yet another&rdquo; distributed version control system some time ago, called <a href="http://veracity-scm.com">Veracity</a>. They said that this is a decent candidate able to compete with all flagship DVCS.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s go right to the comparison table from the official web site.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/veracity-comparison.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>I wanted to figure out unique features for the sake of what they had started this project. I checked out a presentation from OSCON 2011.</p>

<p>#1</p>

<p>#2</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iqDu7s7hSsg?color=white&theme=light"></iframe>

<p>#3</p>

<iframe width="560" height="420" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HH8nFadt9SA?color=white&theme=light"></iframe>

<p>Here is my subjective fifty cents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear &ldquo;no&rdquo; to GPL (a stone into git, hg, bzr). They say that &ldquo;Not-GPL&rdquo; is more attractive for enterprise use.</li>
<li>Ability to use external data storage for the repository (for example, MSSQL or Oracle). Again, large companies may like it.</li>
<li>File locks (a controversial feature, in my view)</li>
<li>Bug tracking (fossil also can do this).</li>
<li>Build tracking (seems to be a really unique feature).</li>
<li>Written in pure C, and it natively supports Windows, Linux and Mac from the day one.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few principle decisions:</p>

<ul>
<li>No &lsquo;index&rsquo; (as in git) and it will never be there.</li>
<li>There is no way to change the history, at all (for example, even a typo in a last commit cannot be fixed).</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally for me, these two &ldquo;features&rdquo; definitely don&rsquo;t fit into my way of using DVCS. For this reason I have stopped using fossil on my personal projects, though I loved the ability to have Wiki and a bug tracker built into the repository.</p>

<p>As a result it turns out that the key features of Veracity are &ldquo;Not-GPL&rdquo; and the external storages. It is obviously an attack on the corporate market. By the way, the company founder, Eric Sink, already had a DVCS product and company now acquired by Microsoft.</p>

<p>So, my subjective conclusion is that this is an attempt to bring DVCS into corporations.</p>

<h3>Extra fifty cents</h3>

<p>Eric Sink wrote a book, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe/">Version Control by Example</a>&rdquo;, in which he gives more or less fair comparison of Veracity against a few flagship DCVS. I flipped through it in half an hour, and I found a super quote, which I furiously share and actively promote (the selection in bold is mine).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>11. Don&rsquo;t comment out code</p>

<p>When using a VCS, you shouldn&rsquo;t comment out a big section of code simply because you think you might need it someday. <strong>Just delete it</strong>. The previous version of the file is still in your version control history, so you can always get it back if and when you need it. This practice is particularly important for web developers, where the commented-out stuff may adversely affect your page load times.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Idea</h3>

<p>Newer use a <code>get</code> prefix for getters.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Usually we consider member functions to be getters if they simply return a reference or pointer to a private member, just for the sake of data incapsulation. Such functions don&rsquo;t do anything really, they have no payload.</p>

<p>So, there is nothing requiring a &ldquo;get&rdquo; verb to describe its meaning. The getter is just an alias of a member. The &ldquo;get&rdquo; prefix is only required when a function does a <strong>real</strong> data transformation or computation, for instance, <code>getLastTick()</code> or <code>getFullUserName()</code>. But it is even better here to replace &ldquo;get&rdquo; by something more meaningful, <code>extractLastTick()</code> and <code>buildFullUserName()</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What&rsquo;s normally happening at office work? Yes, we make dents in seats. Why? We&rsquo;re lazy to get up and have a walk. In rare cases we go to a loo or for a cuppa. But there is a solution to move and stand on feet more at the office. Just use standing desks.</p>

<p>You can find plenty of options online to organize your standing desk. Here is my solution. It appeared by accident. When we rented an apartment, there was no room for a proper computer place in the kitchen (yes, we do need a computer place there, for sure), and my wife discovered this nice cheap table and a bar stool at IKEA.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/90087541/">BJÖRKUDDEN</a></p>

</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/henriksdal-bar-stool-with-backrest.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>We used it for a while as a hotspot for quick googling or ordering food online. After some time at found myself spending more and more time at this place. It was very convenient for some reason. Normally you stand of feet, and sometimes, for example, during a long &ldquo;wave period&rdquo;, you can place your bottom at the high chair. After we moved, I used a regular computer workplace for a while at my office at home, but then switched to the standing desk. This is how it looks:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/standing-desk-at-home.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>By the way, its legs are perfect for fitting socket extensions and other stuff.</p>

<p>And the previous, classical workplace on the right:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/standing-desk-at-home-regular.jpg" alt="" />
</p>

<p>P.S. By the way, I believe that people who invented a pull-out keyboard shelf for computer tables never worked at the computer. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine more inconvenient way of using the keyboard. Also I personally never use any office chair if I cannot sit, resting a foot under myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529260.do">Leonard Richardson, Sam Ruby, &ldquo;RESTful Web Services&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/covers/english/restful-web-services-cover.gif" /></p>

<p>So, skipping a tedious chapter of HTTL libraries in Ruby, Python, Java and curl, more tedious chapter on HTML4, XHTML, HTML5, Atom, XML, a little less tedious chapter about a couple of Ajax libraries, extremely tedious chapter with standard HTTP response codes, unrealistically tedious chapter about standard HTTP headers, the essence of the book can be expressed very briefly. This is my summary of the entire book.</p>

<p>Developing a web-service you should follow some recommendations:</p>

<ol>
<li>(Main one) Designing a URL structure you put as much meaning into there as possible. You should treat URLs as a query language for your data, which is readable and writable by <strong>human</strong>. For example, instead of <code>http://domain/engine.php?func=123&amp;id=test</code> for get user details it should be something like <code>http://domain/users/test</code>.</li>
<li>Use all standard HTTP commands and response codes: not only GET and POST, but also PUT, DELETE, OPTION, HEAD, and not only 200 and 500, but the range of the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP response codes</a>.</li>
<li>HTTP response should contain links to other resources reachable from the current one.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Now you know the whole book.</p>

<p>This is a rare situation when I&rsquo;m seriously considering money back. Unfortunately I cannot re-sell because it&rsquo;s a bloody e-book.</p>

    <updated>2012-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/05/11/retrobsd-on-maximite/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/">wrote</a> how I built Maximite.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was in mood and decided to install <a href="http://retrobsd.org/">RetroBSD</a> there.</p>

<p>RetroBSD is a real UNIX, derived from 2.11BSD and intended for embedded systems with fixed memory mapping. Its target platform is Microchip PIC32 microcontroller with 128KB RAM and 512KB of Flash, which can provide flexible RAM partitioning between user and kernel modes.</p>

<p>RetroBSD implements real preemptive multitasking and memory protection using hardware capabilities. It provides standard POSIX API (fork, exec, wait4, etc.), plus it may have a C compiler in the system allowing on-board development. The kernel is burned into the chip and the filesystem is loaded from an SD-card.</p>

<p>RetroBSD works not only on Maximite, but also on a few alternative boards based on PIC32 (chipKIT Max32, Sparkfun UBW32, Microchip Explorer 16, Microchip PIC32 USB/Ethernet Starter Kit, Olimex Duinomite, Duinomite-Mini and Duinomite-Mega, eflightworks).</p>

<p>After a little fiddling around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mphidflash/">bootloader</a> and <a href="http://retrobsd.org/wiki/installation-2/">library dependencies</a> I managed to build the binaries and upload them onto the device.</p>

<p>A solemn moment of powering on&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/retrobsd-on-maximite-login.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>This is UNIX!</p>

<p>Of course, games first. The Worm.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/retrobsd-on-maximite-worm.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Canfield</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/retrobsd-on-maximite-canfield.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>Now a bit of programming &ndash; Forth.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/retrobsd-on-maximite-forth.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>At the moment RetroBSD only communicates via the serial port and doesn&rsquo;t support VGA and PS/2 interfaces provided by Maximite, but Serge Vakulenko, the author, has their support in the roadmap.</p>

<p>Compiling via clang:</p>

<pre><code>clang++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -O3 -o test test.cpp &amp;&amp; time ./test

<p>Run:</p>

<p>Now <code>value</code> has the correct value at the end, but, of course, this is a dirty non-portable hack for x86 only. For example, this code works for me only if compiled with <code>-O3</code>. Otherwise it crashes with &ldquo;illegal instruction&rdquo; because the compiler injects extra stuff between the LOCK instruction and the following increment or decrement.</p>

<p>The result is correct, and the time is almost the same as with <code>LOCK</code>. Not surprisingly, <code>atomic</code> under cover also uses <code>LOCK</code> but in a portable and guaranteed way.</p>

<p>Now it works much slower, really.</p>

<h2>Benchmark</h2>

<table>
<thead>

<p>Of course, the result depends really on the platform and the compiler (I tested on Mac Air and clang). But for me it was quite interesting to see that spinlock, in spite of its more sophisticated implementation comparing to atomics, works not much slower.</p>

<p>Sadly, my clang 3.1 still doesn&rsquo;t support <code>atomic</code>, and I had to use boost.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I realise that I don&rsquo;t know obvious things. My discovery of today is about Pimpl and smart pointers. For some reason I thought that the forward class declaration is only possible if the class is referenced by a pointer or a reference (#1), that is used in a form of <code>T*</code> or <code>T&amp;</code> (#2). Therefore, when I wanted Pimpl, I didn&rsquo;t use smart pointers because it seemed that it needed the full class definition.</p>

<p><code>A.h</code>:
<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;memory&gt;</span>
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> A_pimpl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> A <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">A</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
  <span class="hl opt">~</span><span class="hl kwd">A</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>unique_ptr<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span>A_pimpl<span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> p<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre></p>

<p>I believed to some reason that it will not work because the class <code>A_pimpl</code> is partially defined. I was surprised as a child when tried and realised that it works! The fact #1 is not equivalent to the fact #2.</p>

<p>Now in <code>A.cpp</code> I can write:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;module.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;pimpl.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

A<span class="hl opt">::</span><span class="hl kwd">A</span><span class="hl opt">() :</span> <span class="hl kwd">p</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwa">new</span> <span class="hl kwd">A_pimpl</span><span class="hl opt">()) {}</span>
A<span class="hl opt">::~</span><span class="hl kwd">A</span><span class="hl opt">() {}</span>
</pre>

<p>Everything above also works for <code>std::shared_ptr</code> (C++ 2011), <code>boost::scoped_ptr</code>, and <code>boost::shared_ptr</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>It is important that class <code>A</code> must an explicitly provided destructor. Moreover, its body must in <code>A.cpp</code>, not in the header. Otherwise, it will be a compilation error, for example, &ldquo;error C2338: can&rsquo;t delete an incomplete type&rdquo;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I managed to attend <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2012">ACCU 2012</a> this year. It was almost all about C++ 2011. One of the presentations I have attended was &ldquo;C++11 concurrency tutorial&rdquo; from <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/people/anthony_williams.html">Anthony Williams</a>. He is, no more no less, the maintainer of boost::thread.</p>

<p>His presentation is <a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/c++11_concurrency.pdf">available</a> with <a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/c++11_concurrency_code.zip">examples</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I missed his second presentation, &ldquo;Dataflow, Actors and High Level Structures in Concurrent Applications&rdquo;. In fact, it was about implementing the concept of actors, similar as in Erlang, in C++ 2011.</p>

<p>This presentation is also <a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/dataflow_and_actors.pdf">available</a> with <a href="http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/dataflow_and_actors_code.zip">examples</a>.</p>

<p>Recommend.</p>

<p>Going further. Anthony&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;C++ Concurrency in Action&rdquo;, has been released recently.</p>

<p>This code consistently crashes (and doesn&rsquo;t throw). When decreasing a number of iteration, at some point to stops crashing.</p>

<p>The compiler cl.exe 17.00.40825.2, IDE 11.0.40825.2 PREREL. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10301432/number-of-async-futures-in-c11">Posted on Stack Overflow</a>. They say, likely it is the bug.</p>

<p>Where to file a bug to VS?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I complained recently, that C++, even on steroids of the new standard, still discourages concurrency and multithreading. In the attempt to break this ice in my heart, I&rsquo;ve tried implementing the multi-threaded QuickSort. After partitioning we can sort sub-arrays in separate threads.</p>

<p>Everything is simple, but it&rsquo;s worth to consider some details. This is a threshold, <code>4096</code>, determining when we switch the parallelism off. Why <code>4096</code>? Just a guess, without a particular explanation.</p>

<h3>Benchmark</h3>

<p>The are three candidates:</p>

<ul>
<li>the naive implementation (using <code>async</code>)</li>
<li>the same naive implementation, but single threaded (replace <code>if (sz &gt; 4096)</code> to <code>if (false)</code>)</li>
<li>std::sort() (replace <code>naive_quick_sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())</code> to <code>std::sort(arr.begin(), arr.end())</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>We sort an array of 50000000 elements of the type <code>int64</code> (signed) with 10 runs and take an average. The values are random:</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t ask me, why I convert the data between big and little endians back and fourth. It was implemented to compare this implementation with another one, in Java. In measurements we count only the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; time.</p>

<p>The compiler is VS 2011, 64-bit. CPU Intel Core i5 2.53GHz, 4 cores.</p>

<p>The time is in milliseconds.</p>

<p>It turns out that the naive implementation based on <code>async()</code> is three times faster then the single threaded <code>std::sort()</code>. A weird slowdown of the <code>std::sort()</code> against my naive single thread version can be explained, perhaps, that the data I generated <em>is good</em>, and my naive implementation is just lucky.</p>

<p>Any practical use out of it at all? Probably not. It is difficult to predict the behaviour of the implementation on different sets of data. For example, how to choose the threshold properly? Is it worth to start using thread pools?</p>

<p>The full source is below, including the generator.</p>

<p>Build and generate the data:</p>

<pre><code>call &quot;%VS110COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat&quot; amd64 &amp;&amp; ^
cl /Ox /DWIN32 sort_async.cpp &amp;&amp; ^
sort_async generate
</code></pre>

<p>Warning! It generates 8GB of data.</p>

<p>Build and test:</p>

<pre><code>call &quot;%VS110COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat&quot; amd64 &amp;&amp; ^
cl /Ox /DWIN32 sort_async.cpp &amp;&amp; ^

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often, when we need a format or a template for date or time, we usually go for something like <code>YYYY</code>, <code>MM</code>, <code>mm:ss</code>, etc). Developing the static blog engine for this blog in Go, I&rsquo;ve come across another approach &ndash; a use the real hardcoded values instead of the special symbols. For instance:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwa">func</span> <span class="hl kwd">format_time</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>t time<span class="hl opt">.</span>Time<span class="hl opt">)</span> <span class="hl kwb">string</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> t<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">Format</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;2006.01.02-15.04.05&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">)</span>  <span class="hl slc">// Similar to YYYY.MM.DD-hh.mm.ss</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/25/endl-vs-new-line/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To this day I believed, that <code>std::endl</code> is always better that <code>\n</code> in C++ streams (portability, for instance). It turns out that no.</p>

<p>A code with <code>std::endl</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;string&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">for</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> i <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span> i <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span> <span class="hl num">1000000</span><span class="hl opt">; ++</span>i<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string <span class="hl kwd">s</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">'x'</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> s <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Compile and run:</p>

<pre><code>clang++ -o endl -O3 endl.cpp &amp;&amp; time ./endl &gt;rubbish

real    0m4.518s
user    0m1.080s
sys 0m3.311s
</code></pre>

<p>A code with <code>\n</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;string&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">for</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> i <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span> i <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span> <span class="hl num">1000000</span><span class="hl opt">; ++</span>i<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string <span class="hl kwd">s</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">'x'</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> s <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">'</span><span class="hl esc">\n</span><span class="hl str">'</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Compile and run:</p>

<pre><code>clang++ -o endl -O3 endl.cpp &amp;&amp; time ./endl &gt;rubbish

real    0m0.263s
user    0m0.236s
sys 0m0.008s    
</code></pre>

<p>The difference is obvious. The second one is much faster.</p>

<p><code>std::endl</code> always <code>flush</code>es the stream. In turn, <code>\n</code> simply puts a new line character to the stream, and in most cases this is exactly what we need. And <code>std::flush</code>, if necessary, can be called afterwards, once, explicitly.</p>

<p>Yesterday the book had arrived. I wanted to write a proper detailed review, but realised it doesn&rsquo;t make sense at all. This is a must have book if you&rsquo;re interested in the new C++ 2011. The book is an exhaustive reference with a lot of examples of the new STL and the language itself. In my view, this is the first big C++ 2011 book at the moment.</p>

<p>It is called live coding. What You Code Is What You See - WYCIWYS.</p>

<p>I thought his demos were hardcoded. But it turns out, there is a real programming language allowing such crazy things in runtime. Check out a short video:</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/23773218" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>The language is called <a href="http://circa-lang.org">circa</a>. Currently it is alpha. On my amateurish opinion in the game development, it is very convenient for experiements with gameplay, at least for 2D games.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting article from the author about <a href="http://circa-lang.org/about/inlined_state.html">preserving the runtime state</a> on live code changes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After Kevlin Henney&rsquo;s training I&rsquo;d realised that an unavailability of a specific unit testing framework in C++ isn’t an excuse to not doing TDD. Just a simple <code>assert</code> macro is enough for unit testing.</p>

<p>For instance, a mini project having one file, and you don’t want to drag the Google Test or cmockery in. I usually do something like this:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;cassert&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">foo</span><span class="hl opt">(...) {</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// something</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl opt">...</span>

<span class="hl ppc">#ifdef UNIT_TESTING</span>
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">Test_for_a_particular_use_case</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// Initialization</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">assert</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>condition_1<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">assert</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>condition_N<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
<span class="hl opt">...</span>
<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(...) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">Test_for_a_particular_use_case</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> “All tests passed<span class="hl opt">.</span>” <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl ppc">#else</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(...) {</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// a proper main</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl ppc">#endif</span>
</pre>

<p>Of course, you still can forget to add your test to <code>main()</code>, and it seems working, but the test simply doesn’t run.</p>

<p>But! All this is trifles in comparison with the advantages which the tests provide.</p>

<h3>P.S.</h3>

<p>By the way, I’ve noticed an interesting habit: when I’m writing a function working with files, I always create two:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">FunctionDoingSomethingFromStream</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>std<span class="hl opt">::</span>istream<span class="hl opt">*</span> is<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">FunctionDoingSomethingFromFile</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> filename<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>ifstream <span class="hl kwd">is</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>filename<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl kwd">FunctionDoingSomethingFromStream</span><span class="hl opt">(&amp;</span>is<span class="hl opt">);</span>  
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>The first function is perfect for testing because you can pass in a mocked <code>std::istringstream</code>. The second doesn’t really need to be tested due to its simplicity. It may be tested though in QA, but not in unit testing during within build.</p>

<p>There is another interesting trick from Kevlin Henny. Usually a subject of testing (a class or a function) has a pre-condition and a post-condition. It’s worth to highlight these stages in comments by “Given”, “When” and “Then” words. For example:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">Test_for_a_particular_use_case_to_check</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// Given:</span>
  ClassToTest a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// When:</span>
  a<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">do_this</span><span class="hl opt">(...);</span>
  a<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">do_that</span><span class="hl opt">(...);</span>
  a<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">setup_something</span><span class="hl opt">(...);</span>
  <span class="hl slc">// Then:</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">assert</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>condition_1<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">assert</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>condition_N<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Such explicit split enforces proper test structuring: without loop and branches, and testing for only one scenario (for another scenario it will be another test).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, working with git, you may forget which branch you are currently in. In this case <a href="https://github.com/djl/vcprompt">vcprompt</a> can help. It allows to see right in the command line prompt various information about your current repository, for example, a current branch name, or a fact of having changed or untracked files.</p>

<p>For example, my <code>PS1</code> variable is:</p>

<pre><code>\W `vcprompt -f &quot;%m%u %s:%b&quot;`\$
</code></pre>

<p>making the prompt in <code>bash</code> to be like this:</p>

<pre><code>_engine +? git:master$
</code></pre>

<p>It says that the current directory is <code>_engine</code> and there is a git repository here, the current branch is <code>master</code>, and there are changed (<code>+</code>) and also untracked files (<code>?</code>). If there is no repo in the current repository, the prompt will be normal.</p>

<p>vcprompt supports not only git, but bzr, cvs, darcs, fossil, hg, svn.</p>

<p>It requires Python, and is also hardly usable on Windows.</p>

    <updated>2012-04-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/23/static-blog-engine-goblog/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love writing, playing with examples, testing, thinking. But I don&rsquo;t like fiddling with formatting, uploading pictures, composing, etc.</p>

<p>Because of laziness I began using Blogspot. It gives plenty of bells and whistles: templates, widgets, instant indexing by Google, statistics, even comments become to be a tree at some point. Everything seems to be great, but alas, the online Blogspot editor isn&rsquo;t designed to create programmer posts. When it requires to insert a code or a table, sufferings begin. For example, for my another blog, not about programming, called &ldquo;<a href="http://english-eggs.blogspot.com">Boiled eggs, sir!</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;the capabilities&rdquo; of Blogspot are more or less enough.</p>

<p>I want to keep sources of the posts in a nice and clear format, not spoiled by HTML. It turned out that the posts sources are spread across my computer here and there, sometimes in multiple copies. You begin creating a post simply in an editor only formatting paragraphs, without links and images, and eventually you save the final version. Then you compose HTML during that the post body maybe also changed. Thus I&rsquo;m lazy to update the original, non-HTML version, so finally, only the spoiled by HTML version remains up to date. But this is not the end of the store still. Often after publishing you spot on a typo, go to the Blogspot online editor and fix it right on the page. Again, that very first document and its local, prior to uploading the HTML version, don&rsquo;t have all the corrections. Ultimately, only the online edition in Blogspot is relevant. Of course, it is possible to export the entire blog from Blogspot (maybe even automatically, on regular basis) and back them up, but again, everything will be in the HTML format.</p>

<p>Some time ago I began using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReST</a>. The life had become a bit easier. ReST allows to write text in the more or less predictable layout (paragraphs, links, code), and then HTML is generated from it, and then later pasted (again, manually) into the Blogspot editor. All my attempts using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlecl/">Google Command Line</a>, in fact, failed. The problem of the outdated original documents (after online fixed) still stood. Furthermore, ReST didn&rsquo;t solve the problem with pictures. I had to upload them somewhere in advance to do the a proper local preview.</p>

<p>I almost cannot explain why, but the idea of dynamic blog engines like WordPress scared me. Use of a database to keep posts seemed to me unnecessarily complicated.</p>

<p>I was almost ready to choose an intermediate solution &ndash; <a href="http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">Doku Wiki</a>, for example, <a href="http://vak.ru/doku.php/proj">vak.ru</a>. This engine is dynamic, but it stores the posts as files. Plus, it supports versioning. Doku can be used as the engine for the whole site, not only the blog. Though its design is unsightly, but pictures and other arbitrary attachments are handled by Doku automatically.</p>

<p>There was another option, which I almost signed up for &ndash; <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. TiddlyWiki is my favorite tool on Windows for notes. Why only Windows? Because on Mac I simply use regular plain text files in Documents or Desktop, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">Spotlight</a> provides the instant search. Therefore on Mac the instant search, the killer feature of TiddlyWiki, didn&rsquo;t make any sense. But I digressed.</p>

<p>It turns out, there are TiddlyWiki fans which converted it to a blog engine, a static-dynamic mutant.</p>

<p>For instance, here is an example of a blog running TiddlyWiki &ndash; <a href="http://rsignell.tiddlyspot.com/">Rich Signell&rsquo;s Work Log</a>. Esoterics, in my opinion. It isn&rsquo;t quite clear even how to implement comments, at least Disqus. But surprisingly, there is public hosting based on Tiddly &ndash; <a href="http://tiddlyspot.com/">tiddlyspot</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I had got hooked on purely static blog engines. The charm of it is that such blog can be hosted anywhere. Neither database nor even no server scripting is required. But further &ndash; it is more. GitHub and Heroku provide not only free hosting but also git as the CMS.</p>

<p>For example, there is a static blog engine called <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. In Jekyll posts are created in Markdown or Textile, therefore the formatting issue is solved. No ugly HTML anymore. In fact, the engine can drive the entire website, not only the blog, plus some source files are deployed as a blog.</p>

<p>The comments, as the main dynamics in blogs, can be implemented via, for instance, <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>. By the way, there is a quite popular pure zen approach to the comments &ndash; static ones (to me, such word combination is the oxymoron in the first place). With the static comments there is a comment entering form somewhere on the page along with the <em>statically</em> rendered existing comments. You enter a comment and submit. Then it gets sent to the blog owner. He or she approves (or rejects) it, clicks somewhere, and the comment is placed to a file. Then the blog is re-compiled and finally deployed to public. Obviously, it is far from real-time, which is the heart of commenting, in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>I very much appreciate discussion, and such approach is not for me. I use Disqus. By the way, all the comments can be easily exported from Disqus, and, for instance, converted to a static form.</p>

<p>But let&rsquo;s go back to Jekyll. GitHub directly supports it (its author is the GitHub co-founder) and can render Jekyll projects for you (of course, you still can render locally). You simply <code>git push</code> your stuff to GitHub, and after a moment it becomes visible in GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Heroku works slightly different. Heroku hosts Ruby, therefore a Heroku project is a bunch of pages, plus a mini web server application serving them. Looks a bit scary, but such server in Ruby is very simple:</p>

<p>As strangely enough it sounds, Heroku as blog hosting is simpler than GitHub. Additionally, your git repository on Heroku remains private, whereas on GitHub by default it is public. I don&rsquo;t see any problems with it though, because it is all available anyway to everybody via the web site, but some people prefer keeping blog guts or bits of unfinished work in private.</p>

<p>Also, both GitHub Pages and Heroku support a proper second level domain if you have one.</p>

<p>Well, I had chosen Jekyll and Heroku hosting. Alas, vanilla Jekyll has no HTML templates or themes, and you have to design it. If you&rsquo;re lazy, you can try <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.</p>

<p>Octopress is a static blog engine based on Jekyll. &ldquo;Based&rdquo; means, this is Jekyll plus a bunch of useful plugins, a very nice HTML5-compatible theme, and scripts helping in deployment to GitHub Pages and Heroku.</p>

<p>So, I had installed Octopress, tried a couple of posts, rendered locally, deployed to GutHub and Heroky. Everything was amazing, I had began the most tedious part &ndash; converting posts from lovely Blogspot. In fact, it was almost pure manual cut-and-paste work. Three weeks of struggle, and my poor three hundred posts were done.</p>

<p>Everything was ready to launch my nice or shiny static blog. But here I had met my main disappointment. The precious Jekyll, written in Ruby, rendered my hundred posts (attention!) 15 minutes (on Mac Air). As you can understand, at the beginning I had to rebuild a hundred of times &ndash; design changes, formatting etc. So, 15 minutes wasn&rsquo;t even close to any acceptable time, at all.</p>

<p>At random, I found a bottle neck in Jekyll/Octopress &ndash; the majority of those 15 minutes were spent generating the RSS file, <code>atom.xml</code>. For some reason, in original templates, that RSS filed included only the latest twenty posts. But my blog is small, and I included all posts there. It had caused that 15 minutes build.</p>

<p>All this seemed to me an absurdity (at all my love to Ruby). After some analysis (at that time I began to understand how Jekyll worked, more or less) and unwillingness to fix Jekyll trying to speed it up, I asked a question &ndash; what if I develop the static engine by myself? using Jekyll&rsquo;s principles? After all it is only work with files, strings, and templates. Besides, I wanted to blog in two languages, but Jekyll didn&rsquo;t support that. Having my own engine seemed to be a very cool idea because I would free to implement exactly that I wanted.</p>

<p>Instrumentation? As a real man in C++/boost? Perhaps. I suspect it would work very fast, but it is boring. I&rsquo;d chosen Go. It is natively compiled, has simplified memory management (thanks to the garbage collector), regular expressions, maps, templates, <a href="https://github.com/russross/blackfriday">Markdown library</a>. Everything, except the later, is out of the box. There should not be any performance issues. Here just the first release of Go had been arrived, now installation on both Windows and Mac became much easier.</p>

<p>So, after three nights, my own wheel had been made &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com">Goblog</a>. The project is fully open. The web site and its source are in the same repository.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>There are two main locations: a project and a target web site/blog. The first contains source files. In the process of assembly the project files are copied to the target directory preserving the relative directory structure. By default, the files are copied &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, as binaries. If a file has one of the following extensions: <code>html</code>, <code>xml</code>, or <code>js</code>, it is processed by <a href="http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go template library</a>. Files with the <code>markdown</code> extension are also processed by the <a href="https://github.com/russross/blackfriday">Markdown library</a>.</p>

<p>Directories:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;root&gt;</code> &ndash; Here is the compiled/built web site as it is visible at <a href="http://demin.ws/">http://demin.ws/</a>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;root&gt;/_engine</code> &ndash; This is the project: source files and the blog generator.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subdirectories and files in <code>_engine</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>_includes</code> &ndash; Include files available by <code>&#123;{include &ldquo;filename&rdquo;}}</code> macro.</p></li>

<li><p><code>_layouts</code> &ndash; Layouts (see below).</p></li>

<li><p><code>_site</code> &ndash; Actually, the source directories and files. This directory is the root of a future site. Files from here are copied to the target directory. Some files are processed by templates.</p></li>

<li><p><code>_posts</code> &ndash; Posts. These files are process specially. Besides templates, they are renamed according to the blog structure, where the date is included to URL: <code>domain/blog/year/month/day/post-title</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The posts are Markdown files having a special preamble and name. These files are deployed to a separate directory, <code>/blog</code>. The post meta information is collected and propagated to the template place holders. Also the post sources are used to <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/9f088a83e86e54112696dd3954681b0450f40d91/_engine/main.go#L601">build the reverted index</a> of search.</p>

<h2>Layouts</h2>

<p>The concept of layouts is grabbed from Jekyll. If a post or a page has the <code>layout</code> attribute in its preamble (<a href="https://raw.github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/master/_engine/_posts/english/2009-01-24-why-i-have-started-this-blog.markdown">for example</a>), a layout of the given name is loaded (from <code>_layouts</code> directory), the post body is put to the <code>Page.child</code> place holder, the layout is rendered, and the result becomes the final HTML page of the post. This is incredibly useful for similar pages, like posts. The layouts can be nested.</p>

<h2>Generator</h2>

<p>Now, the generator &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/master/_engine/main.go">main.go</a>.</p>

<p>To build the blog, I go to the <code>_engine</code> directory and do:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<p>It prints roughly the following:</p>

<pre><code>_engine$ make
gofmt -w=true -tabs=false -tabwidth=2 main.go
go run main.go 
Go static blog generator  Copyright (C) 2012 by Alexander Demin
Words in russian index: 18452
Words in english index: 3563
15.672979s
Processed 344 posts.
</code></pre>

<p>If no errors, in the root directory (in <code>..</code> with regard to <code>_engine</code>) the compiled files should be created, ready for deployment. On my Mac Air the build takes 15 seconds (hello, Jekyll/Octopress and goodbye). The entire project is under git, so it is clear anytime which files are new, deleted, or changed.</p>

<p>Then the built site can be viewed locally (see below).</p>

<p>When you are happy with changes, let&rsquo;s add and submit them (the sources from <code>_site/</code> along with the assembled files) locally:</p>

<pre><code>git add ../*
git commit -m &quot;New post about ...&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>At last, let&rsquo;s deploy to GitHub:</p>

<pre><code>git push
</code></pre>

<p>Almost immediately the files become visible at <a href="http://demin.ws/">demin.ws</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/master/_engine/Makefile">Makefile</a> there is a couple of extra commands making life easier.</p>

<h2>Local testing</h2>

<p>To check/preview the site locally I temporarily add <code>127.0.0.1 demin.ws</code> to <code>/etc/hosts</code> and launch a mini web server. Remember, how it looked in Ruby? Tiny, right? Check out this:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwa">package</span> main
<span class="hl kwa">import</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;net/http&quot;</span>
<span class="hl kwa">func</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">panic</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>http<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">ListenAndServe</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;:80&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> http<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">FileServer</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>http<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">Dir</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;..&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">))))</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Nice? Now run it:</p>

<pre><code>go run server.go&amp;
</code></pre>

<p>It may require <code>sudo</code> to acquire the port 80.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, there is no need touching <code>/etc/hosts</code>, just use <code>localhost:80</code>. Only for checking the RSS file, <code>atom.xml</code>, having full URLs, you have to fiddle with hosts.</p>

<h2>Syntax highlighting</h2>

<p>As a Markdown extension I have a special tag for blocks of code:</p>

<pre><code>{% codeblock lang:xxx %}
...
{% endcodeblock %}
</code></pre>

<p>I inherited the idea from Octopress. Markdown library already has the syntax for code:</p>

<pre><code>``` xxx
...
```
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>xxx</code> is a language.</p>

<p>My own tag aims to add additional attributes easier, for example, turning on the line number, tabs conversion, etc.</p>

<p>Then I had to decide how to highlight the syntax. I tried a couple of online libraries, which color right on the page, but all of them had minor glitches here and there, and I went for static coloring.</p>

<p>The first, which came to my mind, was <a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a>. It seemed okay, but thanks to the Python, it worked really slow. The total built time had increased from 15 seconds to two minutes. The main time was spent for a code coloring. I started thinking about a cache for the already highlighted code and similar nonsense, but after a little research the problem was solved radically.</p>

<p>I just needed a colorizer, implemented in a language suitable for this problem. I found two options: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/">GNU Source-highlight</a> and <a href="http://www.andre-simon.de/doku/highlight/en/highlight.html">Highlight</a>. Both are in C++, the both worked almost instantly.</p>

<p>For example, a guy <a href="http://petereisentraut.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/adding-color-to-console-pygments-vs.html">compared pygments vs syntax-highlight</a>.</p>

<p>I liked Highlight because it supports more languages (for example, the first one even didn&rsquo;t support Go). After migration to Highlight, the built time came to normal, ~15-16 seconds, and I was satisfied.</p>

<p>The colorizer is invoked from the regular expression callback parsing the <code>{% codeblock %}</code> tag (function <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/9f088a83e86e54112696dd3954681b0450f40d91/_engine/main.go#L656">highlight()</a>).</p>

<h2>Markdown editors</h2>

<p>There are plenty of editors having Markdown preview. I use <a href="http://markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a> for Windows and <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> on Mac.</p>

<h2>Tag (categories)</h2>

<p>At the moment I have decided not to use tags at all. Based on a personal experience, I have realised that I never use tag neither in my blog nor in others. Besides, views on the post categorization changes over time, and at times you have to maintain a completely outdated tag just for the sake of uniformity. For example, what is the point of the <code>c++</code> tag in my blog? Who on Earth even used it?</p>

<p>But the minimalism isn&rsquo;t a way to make life more complicated. On the contrary, I search in my old posts all the time. With Blogspot I went to the front page and used &#8984;-F (sorry, CTRL-F) to search across the post titles. Exactly for this purpose I started placing almost all informative posts into the right column on the front page.</p>

<p>In the new blog everything &ldquo;works&rdquo; similar with the post catalog on the front page. During the migration I had improved some titles to be more informative for search.</p>

<p>But! All of this doen&rsquo;t matter anymore because of the <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/10/search-in-this-blog/">fully functional context search capability</a> in the new blog.</p>

<h2>Sanity checks</h2>

<p>One of annoying inconveniences of Jekyll is that it never checks anything in the content. But I passed though it fully converting posts from Blogspot: broken links, missing quotes, bad dates and so on. That&rsquo;s why the Goblog checks everything &ndash; formats, links, overall semantics, and it stops the build in the case of an error. When I added the <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/9f088a83e86e54112696dd3954681b0450f40d91/_engine/main.go#L581">check_links()</a> function, I had found a bunch of dead links.</p>

<h2>Two languages</h2>

<p>There was another issue with Jekyll &ndash; an absence of bilingualism. I want at least two languages in the blog, bit I didn&rsquo;t want to hard code the &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; support of Russian and English. So, I added the concept of the language to each post (or a file), and the language attribute is propagated to templates. Goblog doesn&rsquo;t know about particular languages, but it allows to figure it out in templates.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/master/_engine/_site/index.html">front page in Russian</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/begoon/begoon.github.com/blob/master/_engine/_site/english/index.html">front page in English</a>.</p>

<h2>Minor issues</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like web programming: javascript, css, html, or web design, which I cannot do at all. But I had to do it for Goblog (Octopress was much easier in this). I based my design on the <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Jekyll&rsquo;s author site</a>. The design is very simple. Besides, many people read the blog via RSS anyway and go the blog web site for commenting only. Hence, I need the properly working RSS feed and the post page providing comfortable reading, without fancy fonts and weird formatting.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you think, I&rsquo;ll start convincing you to use my engine? Not at all. I tried to make it flexible and not hard coded specifically to this blog, but I had to migrate my old posts from Blogspot and comments, support two languages etc. At the result there are a couple of places still hard coded (especially in the area of Disqus links).</p>

<p>I can only recommend trying to implement the personal blog engine by yourself. Why? First, it usually takes a few nights only. Second, you will implement the only required bared minimum without complicated and unnecessary bell and whistles. Third, it is fun.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Feuer A., &ldquo;The C puzzle book&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0201604612/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0201604612"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0201604612&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0201604612" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>The first edition of this book was in 1982. Old code in C, which was considered to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; in the past, today quite often doesn&rsquo;t stand up to criticism (even though its criticising is a pointless exercise), but it&rsquo;s worth to study.</p>

<p>I was extremely curious to have a look at puzzles in C created in eighteenth. So, fasten your seat belts. If The Hell in C exists, this is it. I&rsquo;ve given a few &ldquo;problems&rdquo; from this book.</p>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/c-puzzle-book/pointers-and-arrays-pointer-stew.png" alt="" />
</p>

<h2>Preprocessor</h2>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/c-puzzle-book/preprocessor-caution-pays.png" alt="" />
</p>

<h2>Storage classes</h2>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/c-puzzle-book/storage-classes-files.png" alt="" />
</p>

<p>For me, these snippets are obvious candidates for <a href="http://www.ioccc.org">Obfuscated C Code Context</a>. When have to deal with such code in real life, switching to another reality is the the best solution.</p>

<p>After skimming the book to the end (they give the solutions there), you begin to understand its usefulness. Without seeing bad code, it&rsquo;s difficult to recognize the good one.</p>

<p>Just have come across this book in Twitter. A simple search gives plenty of options to read it.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t buy it for myself because for a more or less experienced programmer it doesn&rsquo;t give anything new. But if you have a hour or two, it makes sense, for a tea or a coffee, to browse and refresh in memory various quirks of pointers, memory models (thanks to the weird segmentation inherited from 8086 and 80286), ABI, peculiarities of linking in UNIX and Windows, and interesting facts from the history of the languagemand its editions over time.</p>

<p>This book has a little bit of everything.</p>

<p>P.S. By the way, I thought I know C much better than C++, just because the language is smaller and simpler. More over, I began programming in C much earlier. Thus I&rsquo;d taken a <a href="http://www.brainbench.com/xml/bb/common/testcenter/taketest.xml?testId=52">Brainbench C test</a> at some time, and it turned out that there are still many aspects of the language which I haven&rsquo;t come across so far.</p>

<p>Agreed, the Brainbench is only a test, in many respects far from reality, but nevertheless allowing to expand the scope of self-understanding.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/14/return-vector-by-value-or-pointer/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/14/return-vector-by-value-or-pointer/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine there is a function creating a <code>vector</code>. This function needs to return this vector to the caller. What&rsquo;s the better way doing it?</p>

<p>From clarity perspective the best way is:</p>

<pre class="hl">
std<span class="hl opt">::</span>vector<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> <span class="hl kwd">create_vector</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const size_t</span> N<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>vector<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> v<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  v<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">resize</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>N<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">0xDEADC0DE</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> v<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Here the vector instance is being returned <em>by value</em>, which means potential deep copying of the object to the context of the caller.</p>

<p>Immediately a question raises: if the vector is huge, such deep copying can be expensive but absolutely redundant. A &ldquo;more clever&rdquo; approach could be:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">create_vector</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const size_t</span> N<span class="hl opt">,</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>vector<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">&gt;*</span> v<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  v<span class="hl opt">-&gt;</span><span class="hl kwd">resize</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>N<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">0xDEADC0DE</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Here the vector is passed by pointer which guarantees the absence of deep copying. But this code looks quite bad.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s compare the performance of these two approaches on the 100MB vector of ints. The compiler:</p>

<pre><code>Apple clang version 3.1 (tags/Apple/clang-318.0.45) (based on LLVM 3.1svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin11.3.0
</code></pre>

<p>By value:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;vector&gt;</span>

std<span class="hl opt">::</span>vector<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> <span class="hl kwd">__attribute__</span><span class="hl opt">((</span>noinline<span class="hl opt">))</span>
<span class="hl kwd">create_vector</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const size_t</span> N<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;by value&quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>vector<span class="hl opt">&lt;</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">&gt;</span> v<span class="hl opt">;</span>

<p>Time is both cases is the same. It turns out that it&rsquo;s worth to choose the first one. It looks nicer and cleaner, and it&rsquo;s as fast as &ldquo;by pointer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There are two explanations. The first, probably the main one, is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization">RVO, Return value optimization</a>. In RVO the compiler figures out that the local instance of the vector is supposed to be a return value, and it allocates it directly in the caller context. So it doesn&rsquo;t need to copy it afterwards. In fact, the compiler implements passing by reference, but it does it implicitly, without spoiling the beauty of the source code. This trick works for any classes, not only from STL.</p>

<p>But the optimization isn&rsquo;t guaranteed thing, and there is one more tool. The standard STL containers are implemented such way that even on deep copying they only copy by value a small control structure, and the payload is &ldquo;moved&rdquo; by flipping pointers. It&rsquo;s small overhead, but perhaps it&rsquo;s worthwhile for the sake of preserving the code clarity.</p>

<p>Also in the context of move semantics in C++11 there won&rsquo;t be unnecessary copying at all if the class is &ldquo;properly&rdquo; implemented (which is true for STL classes).</p>

<p>Conclusion: use STL containers where ever possible and trust the compiler. Sometimes, of course, the compiler is wrong, but such cases are much less than vice versa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802301.do">Dustin Boswell, Trevor Foucher, &ldquo;The art of readable code&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/covers/english/art-of-readable-code-cover.gif" alt="" />
</p>

<p>There are plenty of books published about writing code. Thus I was skeptical after a friend of mine showed me yet another one. To my surprise, without a long introduction it went straight to the point and coined the following statements right in the first chapter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code should be easy to understand.</li>
<li>What make code &ldquo;better&rdquo;?</li>
<li>The fundamental theorem of readability.</li>
<li>Code should be written to minimise the time it would take for someone else to understand it.</li>
<li>Is smaller always better?</li>
<li>It is better to clean and precise that to be cute.</li>
</ul>

<p>The style of the book was precise and concrete. I felt that in less than two hundred of pages it&rsquo;s quite ambitious to cover the subject of &ldquo;the art&rdquo; and decided to order the book to find out how they&rsquo;re going to do that.</p>

<p>Eventually, a few hours of reading on weekend were worthy. Though an experienced programmer will barely find any eye openings in the book, but surprisingly, this is a compact, concise and solid handout for juniors. Without too much theory, always using real examples, the authors go through many key points of writing code: how to name variables, functions and classes, how to structure the code, how to deal with efficiency-readability trade off, how to comment, where to compromise and where be a perfectionist. Again, it&rsquo;s all in less then two hundred pages. Plus they briefly touched unit testing.</p>

<p>The authors not only tell you what is good and bad, they always demonstrate &ldquo;why&rdquo; on examples gradually improving &ldquo;regular&rdquo; code. At the end they put a real example of a class counting network traffic and returning a number of bytes transferred in the last hour and day.</p>

<p>They began with a naive implementation and then worked through two more versions showing that sensitive balance between efficiency and readability. I think that even experienced developers may find this example interesting to play with.</p>

<p>To sum up, this book can fit perfectly into your team book shelf and be used as a quick reference of how-tos. Buying for yourself is questionable, because at home you&rsquo;d probably prefer something more fundamental.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Macro for unused parameters]]></title>
    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/12/macro-for-unused-parameters/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/04/12/macro-for-unused-parameters/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes there is a function (or a method) having declared but unused parameters. It can be legacy code or just bad design. Normally the compiler gives a warning about this.</p>

<p>It could be fixed this way:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">f</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl com">/* b */</span><span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>But it looks ugly.</p>

<p>There is a better way:</p>

<pre class="hl">

<span class="hl ppc">#define DISCARD_UNUNSED_PARAMETER(x) (void)x</span>

<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">f</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">DISCARD_UNUNSED_PARAMETER</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>b<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl opt">...</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This macro is clear, and you can easily find all such places in the project.</p>

<p>By they way, in <code>Go</code> this situation is treated as the error, not warning. It can be annoying when you add, remove, comment out and put back things all the time, because sometimes you do have unused stuff. But eventually such approach doesn&rsquo;t allow that temporary garbage to spread and stay in the code (for example, in C++ who on Earth wants to clean up the list of included STL headers after hours of coding?)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As noted, the posts in this blog have no tags anymore. Technically the tags are still supported, but not displayed (no individual feeds per tag, or a cloud of tag, or other kinds of navigation).</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to change the approach and implemented Google&rsquo;s way: Don&rsquo;t sort. Search!</p>

<p>Now, on the <a href="http://demin.ws/english/">main page</a> there is a search. The search allows to filter out the posts containing particular word(s) in the title or body.</p>

<p>The search is based on the reverted index, without sorting by relevance. The posts, containing required words, are displayed sorted by default by date.</p>

<p>Try to search for &ldquo;maximite&rdquo; or &ldquo;ruby nor&rdquo;. If there are several words are given in the search, it&rsquo;ll show the posts containing <strong>all</strong> these words. The words, which are shorter that 3 characters, are ignored.</p>

<p>For me - this is very convenient!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-03/the-nor-machine">article about a virtual CPU, a machine, computing only one instruction - NOR</a>, in The Pragmatic Bookshelf magazine.</p>

<p>The idea was previously described in a series of posts:</p>

<ul>
<li>NORCPU hackme challenge (part 1, part 2)</li>
<li>One-command NORCPU program hacking challenge: analysis and solutions</li>
<li>CPU executing just one operation</li>
</ul>

<p>The article discovers an implementation in Ruby. Now NOR assembly code looks almost as a regular assembler language. I was amazed how powerful Ruby is in creating domain specific languages (DSL). Mostly because it allows to omit parentheses in function calls.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/02/02/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/"/>
    <updated>2012-02-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/02/02/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve finished accelerated reading of &ldquo;<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven languages in seven weeks</a>&rdquo; by Bruce Tate.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/covers/english/7-languages-in-7-weeks-cover.jpg" /></p>

<p>In my case it was &ldquo;Seven languages in seven evenings&rdquo;. For each language there is an introduction, which makes sense only if a language is brand new for you. There are also interviews with creators of the languages. One of the asked interesting questions was about what the author would like to change in the language if he could re-design it from scratch now.</p>

<p>Languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Io</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>Erlang</li>
<li>Clojure</li>
<li>Haskell</li>
</ul>

<p>The reviews of each chapter below are my subjective views two things at once: a programming language and a material about it. Why? For familiar languages it hardly makes any sense to describe the language per se, but to note interesting distinctive features could be useful. But if a languages is a green field, it is worth describe it in general.</p>

<p><strong>Ruby</strong></p>

<p>The Ruby chapter was quite useless for me because I thoughtfully read &ldquo;<a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9">Programming Ruby 1.9</a>&rdquo;, and have been hooked. Ruby is an amazing scripting language. Each time when programming in Ruby I feel so delighted similar to when I tried PHP first time after Perl.</p>

<p>Ruby&rsquo;s creator, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Yukihiro Matsumoto</a>, says in the interview, that if he could re-design Ruby today, he&rsquo;d like to change the concept of multi-threading to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actor</a>.</p>

<p>In short, &ldquo;Actor&rdquo; is when concurrent threads don&rsquo;t share memory and don&rsquo;t use mutex or semaphores for synchronization. Instead, they send and receive messages to each other, and messaging is provided by runtime and built-in to the languages syntax. Examples: Scala, Go, Erlang, Io.</p>

<p><strong>Io</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://iolanguage.com/">Io</a> is a very small, compact language, based on prototypes like JavaScript, where there is no distinction between classes and objects.</p>

<p>There is an interesting concurrency feature in addition to actors and coroutines (cooperative multi-threading as in <a href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#2.6">Lua</a>), called futures. &ldquo;Futures&rdquo; are similar to the actor. There the only difference is when the caller thread tries to use the result of the future, it will be blocked until the future completes and gives the result back.</p>

<p>An example from the book:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl opt">//</span> Fire up the future<span class="hl opt">.</span>
futureResult <span class="hl opt">:=</span> <span class="hl kwb">URL</span> <span class="hl kwd">with</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;http://google.com/&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">) &#64;</span>fetch
<span class="hl kwd">writeln</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;Continue immediately when future is running in background.&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">)</span>
<span class="hl opt">//</span> This line will be executed immediately after spawning the future<span class="hl opt">.</span>
<span class="hl kwd">writeln</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;fetched &quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> futureResult size<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl str">&quot; bytes&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">)</span>
<span class="hl opt">//</span> But this line will be blocked until the future returns<span class="hl opt">.</span>
</pre>

<p><strong>Prolog</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been gnawing this animal for years. But thanks to Erlang recently, all this functional stuff in general is now giving up for me, and monsters like Prolog or Haskell don&rsquo;t look so scary anymore.</p>

<p>It turned out that the depth of the material about Prolog has matched precisely with my level. The eight queens problem and a Sudoku solver were excellent examples for me.</p>

<p>Shortly, a program in Prolog is a pile of facts and rules. Then the Prolog runtime performs a depth-first search amongst possible results and tries to find those satisfying all the given facts and rules.</p>

<p>In fact, the Sudoku solver program is a set of variables, representing the Sudoku field, and a list of rules (summations by columns, rows and squared groups) according to the rules of Sudoku. Then Prolog performs an exhaustive search to find the values and their combinations satisfying the rules.</p>

<p>Of course, this is very much a superficial glance, but this has given me much more understanding of Prolog.</p>

<p><strong>Scala</strong></p>

<p>I will note only a few facts interesting to me.</p>

<p>Multi-threading is based on actors. After Erlang and Go you understand how good and handy it is.</p>

<p>I think that Scala has all possible bells and whistles even invented for programming languages. But sometimes it has not only good consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Erlang</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Erlang and already read a few big books. That&rsquo;s why this book hasn&rsquo;t given to me anything new. But for novices this introduction may give quite solid view on Erlang functional approach and concurrency model.</p>

<p><strong>Clojure</strong></p>

<p>Clojure is a Lisp-based language driven by Java VM.</p>

<p>It has an interesting feature called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">STM, software transactional memory</a>. In STM a piece of code is declared to be a transaction. It is executed atomically or all the changes of variables are rolled back.</p>

<p>And finally, Haskell</p>

<p>Haskell is a taught guy. The introduction in this book is very light and minimal, just to remember the word &ldquo;Haskell&rdquo;. I read &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/0521692695">Programming in Haskell</a>&rdquo; and currently I&rsquo;m on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-World-Haskell-Bryan-OSullivan/dp/0596514980">Real World Haskell</a>&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s why I simply skimmed the chapter in this book.</p>

<p>Okay, to sum up. This book is to be read just once, to broaden your outlook.</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/30/my-current-languages/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve realised recently that I like to learn new programming languages. A symptom is a very easy to spot: I have a permanent pile of books I&rsquo;m reading. Thanks for the iPad, I can have them all with me all the time and choose depending on mood. Surprisingly, but books about languages are being read first and replaced with new ones.</p>

<p>Simply wanted to share current interests.</p>

<p>Everyday work (design, planning, coding and reviews): C and C++. C++ 0x11 goes at full speed and it is worth to catch up. <a href="http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2012/accu2012_schedule">ACCU 2012</a> is almost fully dedicated to the new C++.</p>

<p>For fun:</p>

<ul>
<li>scripting - Ruby</li>
<li>a server side and multi-threading: Erlang and Go</li>
<li>embedded: Lua and Scheme</li>
</ul>

<p>To &ldquo;gnaw&rdquo; in hope to write something real - Haskell and Prolog.</p>

<p>In a queue at least minimum acquaintance: Clojure. This one is more promising because it is Lisp.</p>

<p>After overall migration to Mac, I wish to try Objection-C and AppleScript in action. But what to write on Mac, in Objective-C? Of course, UI! But UI is totally out of my interests. But, Objective-C still looks tempting because of so quickly growing mobile apps market.</p>

<p>From recently touched, but not involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scala - a sophisticated language requiring a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo;, and without a real suitable problem the interest is gone. Twitter is already re-written in Scala ;-).</li>
<li>Racket - an interesting Lisp based animal on steroids of a very powerful library.</li>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/26/graph-visualization-in-dot/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/26/graph-visualization-in-dot/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Background. We do financial transactions processing. At some point we decided that we need profiling. We could record a path of how a transaction being passed amongst modules. There are two options - either to do static analysis or to trace the runtime.</p>

<p>So, the connections are determined and now we have to formalize and visualize them.</p>

<p>At the first glance this is not an easy task, but it turned out there is a simple and elegant solution.</p>

<p>There is a plain text language to declare graphs &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language">DOT</a>. Its beauty is in ultimate simplicity. For example, a trivial graph:</p>

<pre><code>graph name {
  a -- b
  b -- c
  b -- d
}
</code></pre>

<p>Feed it to special software and get this:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/dot-graph.png" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! The output is in SVG, ready to stick on a wall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the best software I&rsquo;ve found to visualize DOT is <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>. It does pretty decent job properly processing quite sophisticated graphs, but in terms of user experience it&rsquo;s shite.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested, I&rsquo;ve shared a <a href="http://demin.ws/downloads/dot/graph.gv">real trace</a> (obviously, names are obfuscated). It gives an idea about simplicity of the source and visualization capabilities - <a href="http://demin.ws/downloads/dot/graph.png">PNG</a> and <a href="http://demin.ws/downloads/dot/graph.svg">SVG</a>.</p>

<p>Again, the graph formalization is dead simple - you only need to specify pairs of connected vertices. Also, in DOT you can describe directed graphs and extra attributes of the vertices.</p>

<p>To sum up, great technology.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/19/maximite-kit/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have come across an interesting project - Maximite.</p>

<p>This is a micro-computer based on Microchip PIC32 running BASIC. It is so simple that even a novice can build it in a few hours.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0099.jpg" /></p>

<p>It is a bit more powerful than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_hardware_in_Soviet_Bloc_countries#Radio-86RK">Radio-86RK</a> and ZX Spectrum 48. But its peripherals are fantastic: SD/FAT card, USB, VGA, PS/2, timers, RS232, I2C, SPI, PWM, ADC/DAC and individual general purpose pins.</p>

<p>If you build it on a mock up board buying parts by yourself, it will cost less then ten Australian dollars.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://geoffg.net/maximite.html">project is open-sourced</a> (schematics, PCB artwork, sources).</p>

<p>Even if quickly flip through the <a href="http://geoffg.net/maximite.html#Downloads">documentation</a>, no doubts - a list features is impressive. All peripherals are available directly from BASIC.</p>

<p>Programs and data can be stored on a SD card. If there is a &ldquo;AUTORUN.BAS&rdquo; file on the card, BASIC will run at the start.</p>

<p>I liked Maximite, but soldering is not my favourite activity. Unfortunately it is only possible to buy a kit, but not a fully assembled unit.</p>

<p>I ordered the <a href="http://www.altronics.com.au/index.asp?area=item&amp;id=K9550">kit from Altronics</a> and soon after it arrived.</p>

<p>Only the microprocessor was already soldered because soldering such form factor chip isn’t an easy task.</p>

<p>Anyway, screw it, let’s do it.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0102.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here a few parts are already in place. I’m not a complete newbie in soldering but last time I took a soldering iron in my hands was about five years ago. I had no acid for soldering, so I was crumbling rosin right to soldering points. The effect is similar to acid. The soldering iron (the one on the plate) with a sharp sting.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0103.jpg" /></p>

<p>I spent the first hour struggling with only a few parts, but eventually it went smoother.</p>

<p>A half is ready.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0106.jpg" /></p>

<p>After one more hour it was all done.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0107.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0110.jpg" /></p>

<p>Maximite can be powered from an external 9V source or form USB. I used USB.</p>

<p>Plug into USB and VGA. An off you go!</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0111.jpg" /></p>

<p>BASIC is ready but there is no keyboard. I hand’t a proper PS/2 one and I tried a USB-PS/2 connector. Alas, it didn’t fit.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0119.jpg" /></p>

<p>Next day I found the PS/2 keyboard and finally connected.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0114.jpg" /></p>

<p>The case.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0115.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0112.jpg" /></p>

<p>Fully assembled.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0113.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0116.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have to admit - the kit from Altronics is a very good quality product. The holes are metallized on the board, and the case fits perfectly.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/img_0118.jpg" /></p>

<p>Then I had to upgrade the firmware to the latest version. Maximite can flash itself over USB without a special programmer. Just open the case and hold a special button when switching Maximite on. It goes to a boot loader mode.</p>

<p>Maximite is a standard CDC device in USB infrastructure. Windows still requires a driver though, but Mac has it built-in.</p>

<p>Plug-in.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01130.jpg" /></p>

<p>Flashing.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01129.jpg" /></p>

<p>Right, the firmware is upgraded up to 3.0A.</p>

<p>As I said, Maximite supports VGA and PS/2, but you can also connect it to a PC via USB. In this case Maximite mirrors the VGA output to that serial connection to the PC, also treats the data coming from that connection as keyboard input.</p>

<p>So, it is possible to detach VGA and PS/2 at all and talk to Maximite over the serial USB connection only.</p>

<p>For example, VGA dispay (voltmeter):</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01125.jpg" /></p>

<p>The same data on in a terminal emulation application on the PC:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01123.jpg" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, Maximite works with pixels, not characters. So when a character is being displayed, it is also copied to the console, but when Maxitile draws graphics it is not visible in the serial console.</p>

<p>BASIC language in Maximite gives full control over the peripherals using operators.</p>

<p>There is an archive of BASIC programs running on Maximite available of the project website.</p>

<p>There are a few screenshots.</p>

<p>Clock.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01132.jpg" /></p>

<p>Character editor.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01128.jpg" /></p>

<p>Voltmeter.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01133.jpg" /></p>

<p>Puzzles.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01126.jpg" />
<img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01131.jpg" /></p>

<p>I believe, no comment here.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/maximite-kit/dsc01134.jpg" /></p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>Every penny I have spent on Maximite is worth that fun I’ve got.</p>

<p>The Maximite project is surprisingly solid. Everything is nice and simple. And it works!</p>

<p>For beginners, even kids, interested in microelectronics, Maximite is simply a godsend. Easy and nice to build. I as an amateur have built everything in a few hours only.</p>

<p>When my brother was building <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">Radio-86RK Emulator</a> and Spectrum about twenty years ago, there was a joke about DIY projects published in radio electronics magazines: if a author says that his device doesn’t required any tuning, there is at least a little chance to get it working; but the author says that his device does require some minor tuning&hellip;</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to come back to your 8-bit youth with a soldering iron in hands — build Maximite.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/05/stuck-process-detector/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/01/05/stuck-process-detector/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a problem — how to automatically detect stuck long running server processes? Say if a process is stuck it means there is a deadlock or it is spinning in an infinite loop.</p>

<p>An idea — periodically take a snapshot of the process stack trace. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>#0  0x991a8c22 in mach_msg_trap ()
#1  0x991a81f6 in mach_msg ()
#2  0x968870ea in __CFRunLoopServiceMachPort ()
#3  0x96890214 in __CFRunLoopRun ()
#4  0x9688f8ec in CFRunLoopRunSpecific ()
#5  0x9688f798 in CFRunLoopRunInMode ()
#6  0x92158a7f in RunCurrentEventLoopInMode ()
#7  0x9215fd9b in ReceiveNextEventCommon ()
#8  0x9215fc0a in BlockUntilNextEventMatchingListInMode ()
#9  0x90010040 in _DPSNextEvent ()
#10 0x9000f8ab in -[NSApplication nextEventMatchingMask:untilDate:inMode:dequeue:] ()
#11 0x9000bc22 in -[NSApplication run] ()
#12 0x902a018a in NSApplicationMain ()
#13 0x0012e356 in main ()
</code></pre>

<p>For Linux, HPUX and Solaris there is a tool called <code>pstack</code>, and <code>procstack</code> on AIX. I’m sure it is possible to do the same on Windows because Process Explorer can do it.</p>

<p>Comparing the current stack trace with the previous one we can measure how much it has been changed. If the stack wasn’t changed at all or only a few deepest lines were changed (for example, inside the kernel), we may assume that this process is stuck. The deadlock on a file or database is even simpler because the code will be blocked on a function inside the kernel.</p>

<p>Of course, such detector has to be adjusted for specifics of the monitored processes. But it can be configurable via regular expressions or a script language as Lua, for instance.</p>

<p>The good thing is that such monitor doesn’t require any changes in the target software, and can be implemented on any language suitable for easy text parsing, for example, Ruby or Python.</p>

<p>Am I reinventing a wheel?</p>

  <span class="hl kwd">bar</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>t<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>The problem is that the function <code>bar</code> is a part of a legacy library which we cannot refactor right now. The signature of <code>bar</code> is <code>void bar(T*)</code>. <code>T</code> is not <code>const</code>. But in reality <code>bar</code> never changes an object referenced by <code>t</code>. This is how it was implemented.</p>

<p>But <code>foo</code> is a part of a brand new API, and we want to make nice or clean. The contract of the function <code>foo</code> says that it doesn’t need to change its parameter.</p>

<p>I think the code should be like this:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">foo</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const</span> T<span class="hl opt">*</span> t<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">bar</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwa">const_cast</span><span class="hl opt">&lt;</span>T<span class="hl opt">*&gt;(</span>t<span class="hl opt">));</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Why? The contact of foo doesn’t require the pointer t to be non-const. We must reflect this in the API by making <code>t</code> <code>const</code>. It doesn’t matter that for some reason a particular implementation of <code>foo</code> is based on the legacy <code>bar</code> function not having <code>const</code> in the argument but never changing it. Yes, we have to use the ugly <code>const_cast</code> but this bad code is nicely isolated inside <code>foo</code> only and doesn’t affect our nice and clean brand new API. Moreover, if we refactor <code>foo</code> at some point and get rid of legacy <code>bar</code> at all, the problem will disappear completely.</p>

<p>Here is a counterargument from my colleague: it may turn out that the function <code>foo</code> can have a bug and accidentally change <code>t</code> even it is declared as <code>const</code>. The solution is to simply keep the argument of <code>foo</code> non-const. In this case we don’t need that cast, we explicitly show to an end user of <code>foo</code> that she should expect its parameter to be <code>const</code>, and eventually we never violate the contact of the function <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>Eventually we haven’t agreed. My flaw is that <code>const</code> doesn’t really protect from side effects coming from legacy <code>bar</code> and the argument of <code>foo</code> may be changed regardless being <code>const</code>. My friend’s flaw is that it is not easy to explain in the documentation how and why the argument of <code>foo</code> may be changed. Just because our particular implementation dictates this? Such approach spreads the drawback of the legacy code to our nice and shiny new code.</p>

<p>Dilemma.</p>

<p>P.S. There is another esoteric approach — to create a temporary deep copy of <code>T</code> inside <code>foo</code> and pass it to <code>bar</code> by non-const pointer. Personally if I have to choose between quick but badly designed code and slow but nicely written code I usually go for the second one. Tomorrow we can buy another faster computer and the slow code will be faster, but that computer will make the bad code better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Steve Jobs: The Exclusive Biography&rdquo; by Walter Isaacson</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1408703742/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1408703742"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=1408703742&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1408703742" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>I thought that biographies are for &ldquo;old people&rdquo;. This book has changed that mindset in me. Being driven by massive ads and recently emerged love with Apple products and philosophy I had started reading.</p>

<p>Initially it was like an expanded version of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/">Pirates of Silicon Valley</a>&rdquo; which I, frankly, liked, but as reading progressed I had just fallen in love with this book and weren&rsquo;t able to stop.</p>

<p>The book can be treated as conjuncture or just an attempt to leverage the situation that Steve has just passed away. I was fully biased but after the first chapter I was hooked.</p>

<p>It is fascinating reading. Maybe just because the author is talented, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Conclusion: strongly recommend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century&rdquo;, Thomas L. Friedman</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0312425074/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0312425074"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0312425074&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0312425074" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>This is a killer book to understand or even discover that nowadays:</p>

<ul>
<li>individuals can compete with corporations</li>
<li>an importance of engineering and especially computer education is increasing enormously</li>
<li>a number of places on the Earth when you can have decent life doing what you love to do is not narrowed to the US and a few EU countries anymore</li>
<li>India, China, Russia and many other countries have a very strong position competing with even US now without immigration permanent self education and nurturing your curiosity (CQ + PQ always greater that IQ) is the only way to remain valuable</li>
</ul>

<p>And many other topics.</p>

<p>Frankly, there were moments in my life when I doubted and thought I would be better off doing, for instance, real estate, natural resources, ads or media rather than software. If you have even a tiny similar concern this book will wipe it out forever, and maybe even show the way.</p>

<p>To conclude: very useful, interesting and fascinating reading.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/12/21/virtual-private-functions-in-cpp/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/12/21/virtual-private-functions-in-cpp/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve come across an interesting in my point of view bit of code. There was a virtual private function. The approach is odd at the first place and I thought it shouldn&rsquo;t even compile, but surprisingly it did. I felt that this was yet another gap in my C++.</p>

<p>I wrote this code:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwc">class</span> A <span class="hl opt">{</span>
<span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">bar</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span> <span class="hl kwd">foo</span><span class="hl opt">(); }</span>
<span class="hl kwc">private</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwc">virtual</span> <span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">foo</span><span class="hl opt">() =</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>

<span class="hl kwc">class</span> B<span class="hl opt">:</span> <span class="hl kwc">public</span> A <span class="hl opt">{</span>
<span class="hl kwc">private</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwc">virtual</span> <span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">foo</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;B::foo()&quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">char</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> argv<span class="hl opt">[]) {</span>
  A<span class="hl opt">*</span> a <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl kwa">new</span> <span class="hl kwd">B</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
  a<span class="hl opt">-&gt;</span><span class="hl kwd">bar</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">delete</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>VS2010 and GCC compile it perfectly and it prints out <code>B::foo()</code>.</p>

<p>I have concluded that the virtual function mechanism usually implemented via vtable is runtime, but public/private is compile time, and they don&rsquo;t depend on each other.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub as a blog engine]]></title>
    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/12/18/blogging-on-github/"/>
    <updated>2011-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/12/18/blogging-on-github/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To say that Blogspot (Blogger) infuriates me is to say nothing. The only benefit of it is fast indexing by Google.</p>

<p>Artemy Lebedev said that he despises all this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> bullshit because it is much more productive to focus on creating great posts rather than thinking how to attract more readers. His <a href="http://tema.livejournal.com/">LJ</a> uses a default template without even minor tweaks to make it looking “cool”. Despite of this his blog is in Russian Top 10.</p>

<p>Nobody reads blogs directly nowadays. Everybody uses Google Reader or other aggregators making the design of blogs absolutely pointless.</p>

<p>Anyway let’s leave odious Lebedev and come back to our techy blogs. Tom Preston-Werner, one of the Github founders, <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">said that he wanted to write posts</a> but not tweaking different templates or keeping the version of WordPress or Mephisto up to date.</p>

<p>A similar thought haunts me from the day one of using Blogspot. Only recently I have sorted a way of creating post by using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">ReST</a>. Now I write posts in this markup and convert to HTML before publishing by a few handcrafted scripts. Unfortunately hosting for images is not automated in anyway.</p>

<p>Many times I wanted to migrate to a standalone platform, for example, WordPress. But my laziness and unwillingness to spend even a second on its maintenance always stopped me.</p>

<p>At the moment I have another attack of hate to Blogspot and as a consequence look for alternatives.</p>

<p>Surprisingly I never considered using <a href="http://www.subspacefield.org/~travis/static_blog_generators.html">static blog engines</a>.</p>

<p>What if just simply migrate to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>? It converts one of your repositories to a website which can be also processed by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static engine from Tom Preston-Werner.</p>

<p>I could kill a few birds with one stone – to use a proper markup language, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">Textile</a>, instead of bloody HTML and to manage publishing by git. Of course ReST is better but I can cope with it.</p>

<p>Also GitHub Pages can be integrated with your own domain if needed.</p>

<p>Comments and discussions. <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> seems to be an easiest way to sort it without any hassle.</p>

<p>Google Analytics perfectly works with any engine where you can insert their JavaScript hook into pages.</p>

<p>What is still missing?</p>

<p>Sometimes people still visit blogs directly, for instance, to find previous posts or explore “social” details. In this case all these bells and whistles in a form of JavaScript gadgets are very useful and save a lot of time. Blogspot allows adding them in a few clicks.</p>

<p>But coming back to the question at the beginning – do I really need them? If the content is interesting the audience will inevitably find you. A word of mouth in a form of Twitter or Facebook will attract people. But if the content is crap all those bells and whistles (and SEO) will not help.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/10/02/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/10/02/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I read in papers that Google has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8800002/Worlds-first-Google-store-opens-in-London.html">launched an offline shop for Chromebooks</a>.</p>

<p>I went to check out the stop and the Chromebook.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Shop&rdquo; is a two desk place with a dozen of demo notebooks in the <a href="http://www.pcworld.co.uk/gbuk/s/find-a-store.html?iStoreId=696">PC World</a> nearby Apple, Sony and other departments.</p>

<p>The Chromebook demoing there is <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/samsung-series-5-3g-chromebook-white-10822582-pdt.html">Samsung Series 5 3G</a>.</p>

<p>Below there are a few not quite good quality pictures I&rsquo;ve done during an hour playing with this device at the shop.</p>

<p>Closed lid.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-closed-lid.jpg" /></p>

<p>Left - power, a weird video connector, USB and audio.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-left-side.jpg" /></p>

<p>Right - one more USB.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-right-side.jpg" /></p>

<p>Front - SD.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-sd-port.jpg" /></p>

<p>The power socket is quite fragile.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-power-connector.jpg" /></p>

<p>Look at the keyboard.</p>

<p>Above Shift there is an interesting button called &ldquo;Search&rdquo; opening a new tab and pointing the cursor to the URL bar. In fact, CTRL-T. I liked this button.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-search-button.jpg" /></p>

<p>There are internet related buttons in the top row. The button between full screen and the brightness is the switch amongst Chrome windows when there are multiple of them opened.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-inet-buttons.jpg" /></p>

<p>There are no Ins, Del, Page Up and Page Down.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-no-ins-del-pgup-pgwn.jpg" /></p>

<p>After 8 seconds of boot time you see a login window for your Google Account (I used a demo one), and then the main screen comes out.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-main-screen.jpg" /></p>

<p>In Chromebook there is only one application - the Chrome browser. It is not possible to exit from it. You can only open new tabs and windows.</p>

<p>The Chrome itself differs from its desktop version. There are extra menus. For example, network settings.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-network-settings.jpg" /></p>

<p>WiFi</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-wifi-selector.jpg" /></p>

<p>Russian keyboard layout is configurable through the settings.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-russian.jpg" /></p>

<p>Printing works via a direct connection to a USB printer (HCL is provided), or a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; Google way printing via Cloud Print.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-cloud-print.jpg" /></p>

<p>It is possible to keep files locally. For instance, you can attach them to e-mails.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-local-file-open.jpg" /></p>

<p>Only a few types of files allow to do anything with them. For example, photos and vides can be uploaded to WebPicasa.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-local-file-storage.jpg" /></p>

<p>All downloads and screenshots also go to the local storage.</p>

<p>Skype was not available, so I tried GTalk (this is mine shaved head in the window).</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-gtalk.jpg" /></p>

<p>GTalk settings.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-gtalk-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>After a few minutes of jiggling around GTalk crashed.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-gtalk-crash.jpg" /></p>

<p>Of course, I checked out the <a href="http://easy-coding.blogspot.com">right website</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-easycoding.jpg" /></p>

<p>And <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">another one</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-volcano.jpg" /></p>

<p>And <a href="http://bellard.org/jslinux/">another one</a> to figure out the overall performance.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/chromebook-samsumg-5-3g-review/chromebook-jslinux.jpg" /></p>

<p>Linux booted in 33 seconds. On my Mac Air Core Due it boots in 8 seconds. But bogomips were the same (~20) for some reason.</p>

<p>Now my biased conclusion.</p>

<p>400 quid is nuts. The notebook itself isn&rsquo;t light, tiny and slick, which could be an excuse for such high price, but there are a dozen of other netbooks around doing the same stuff, plus the rest.</p>

<p>Even at the shop, where WiFi was really fast, working fully online becomes annoying very soon due to network lags. The official &ldquo;Offline Gmail&rdquo; is available but it is a joke, and barely usable seriously.</p>

<p>For 50 quid I could buy it right there, just because I use Google&rsquo;s products and is willing to play with this &ldquo;Google Console&rdquo;, but 400 is &ldquo;no, thank you&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There is a problem here because the parameters of <code>strcpy()</code> overlap.</p>

<p>This is an unpredictable behaviour because <code>strcpy()</code> doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the order of moving bytes (from left to right or vice versa) but the result depends on it.</p>

<p>Check on different compilers and platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Studio 2010 64-bit</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1123446788012245]
</code></pre>

<p>The result is corrupted every four bytes. Obviously, it has been copied 32 bit words.</p>

<p><strong>Linux 64-bit</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1123456788012345]
</code></pre>

<p>The result is now different. Compiler and libc:</p>

<pre><code>ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.5

gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-50)
</code></pre>

<p><code>man strcpy</code> says:</p>

<pre><code>The strings may not overlap...
</code></pre>

<p>Why not &ldquo;must not&rdquo;?</p>

<p><strong>Solaris (SPARC)</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1123446788012245]
</code></pre>

<p>Compiler and libc:</p>

<pre><code>cc -V
cc: Sun C 5.8 2005/10/13

version /usr/lib/libC*
version of &quot;/usr/lib/libC.so.3&quot;: SC2.0.1 12/20/94 Sun C++ 3.0.1 patch 100962-09
version of &quot;/usr/lib/libC.so.5&quot;: Sun SUNWlibC SunOS 5.10 Patch 119963-06 2006/04/21

version of &quot;/usr/lib/libCstd.so.1&quot;: Sun SUNWlibC SunOS 5.10 Patch 119963-06 2006/04/21
</code></pre>

<p><strong>AIX</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1111111111012245]
</code></pre>

<p>This result is clearly wrong. The man pages are pretty clear on it:</p>

<p><em>String movement is performed on a character-by-character basis and starts at the left. Overlapping moves toward the left work as expected, but overlapping moves to the right may give unexpected results.</em></p>

<p>Compiler and libc:</p>

<pre><code>lslpp -L | grep Compiler
vacpp.cmp.core            8.0.0.20    C     F    IBM XL C/C++ Compiler

lslpp -L | grep libc
bos.rte.libc               5.3.9.1    C     F    libc Library
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HP-UX</strong></p>

<pre><code>[1123456789012345]
</code></pre>

<p>Compiler:</p>

<pre><code>what `which cc`

HP C/aC++ for Integrity Servers B3910B A.06.22 [Nov 14 2008]
</code></pre>

<p>This result is correct but man pages warn in a funny way:</p>

<p><em>Character movement is performed differently in different implementations, so moves involving overlapping source and destination strings may yield surprises.</em></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: <code>strcpy()</code> is bad, due to many reasons.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph">bipartite graph</a>: &ldquo;n&rdquo; vertices on the left, &ldquo;m&rdquo; on the right and edges. The question is: how many edges in this graph are crossed?</p>

<p>In this example n=5, m=4, ten edges: 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-1, 4-3, 5-1, 5-2, 5-4, a number of crossings: 10.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/bipartite-graph.gif" /></p>

<p>Crossings are always considered in pairs. For example, if three edges are crossed in one physical point, formally there are still three crossings, not one.</p>

<p>O(n*m) solution exists.</p>

    <updated>2011-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/05/24/safer-sizeof-for-arrays-in-cpp/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you have to deal with raw arrays and pointers to them in C++, and also determine a number of elements in the array at compile time.</p>

<p>For example, it can be done this way:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#define arraysize(array) (sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]))</span>
</pre>

<p>But there is a little problem over there. If accidently a pointer is passed to the this macro instead of an array, the code still compiles but the value will be far from being conceived.</p>

<p>There is a way to make this macro safer.</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">template</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span>typename T<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">size_t</span> N<span class="hl opt">&gt;</span>
<span class="hl kwb">char</span> <span class="hl opt">(&amp;</span><span class="hl kwd">ArraySizeHelper</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwd">T</span> <span class="hl opt">(&amp;</span>array<span class="hl opt">)[</span>N<span class="hl opt">]))[</span>N<span class="hl opt">];</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#define arraysize(array) (sizeof(ArraySizeHelper(array)))</span>
</pre>

<p>Looks cryptic, but we can break it apart:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>T (&amp;array)[N])</code> - an array definition (<code>T array[N]</code>) passed by reference</li>
<li><code>char (&amp;ArraySizeHelper(...)[N]</code> - a function returning a array by reference</li>
<li><code>sizeof(ArraySizeHelper(array))</code> - take a size of the function return value type</li>
<li>This is a template function, parameterized by an array type and its size deduced automatically by the compiler. The function isn&rsquo;t called, so its definition is not required.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, it is not easy to get it. But this macro is great.</p>

<p>By the way, we can play with <code>sizeof()</code> of the function return value type:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;string&gt;</span>

std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string <span class="hl kwd">f</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span><span class="hl kwd">string</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl kwa">sizeof</span><span class="hl opt">( (&amp;</span>f<span class="hl opt">)() ) &lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl kwa">sizeof</span><span class="hl opt">(</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>string <span class="hl opt">) &lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>My VS2010 prints out &ldquo;28&rdquo; twice.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in C it is also possible:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">struct</span> t <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">char</span> x<span class="hl opt">[</span><span class="hl num">1024</span><span class="hl opt">];</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>

<span class="hl kwb">struct</span> t <span class="hl kwd">f</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">struct</span> t a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;%d</span><span class="hl esc">\n</span><span class="hl str">&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwa">sizeof</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">struct</span> t<span class="hl opt">));</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;%d</span><span class="hl esc">\n</span><span class="hl str">&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwa">sizeof</span><span class="hl opt">( (*</span>f<span class="hl opt">)() ));</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>It prints out <code>1024</code> twice.</p>

<p>To me personally the expression <code>&quot;12345678&quot;[i]</code> cuts the eye. But from the language point of view everything is fine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To my shame, I thought that Windows still lives in the previous century without links in the file system. I knew about junctions, links to directories, which can be created, for instance, in FAR via Alt-F6.</p>

<p>But today, thumbing through &ldquo;Windows Internals&rdquo;, I came across a paragraph about it.</p>

<p>So, there is a little log from the console (Windows 7).</p>

<pre><code>ver

Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
</code></pre>

<p>Create a file and a directory:</p>

<p>cd C:\Temp\links
C:\temp\links&gt;mkdir folder
C:\temp\links&gt;echo &gt;file</p>

<p>Create a symbolic link to the directory:</p>

<pre><code>C:\temp\links&gt;mklink /D link1 folder
symbolic link created for link1 &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; folder
</code></pre>

<p>Create a junction to the directory (it isn&rsquo;t possible to point it to a file):</p>

<pre><code>C:\temp\links&gt;mklink /J link2 folder
Junction created for link2 &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; folder
</code></pre>

<p>Create a symbolic link slightly differently:</p>

<pre><code>C:\temp\links&gt;mklink link3 folder
symbolic link created for link3 &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; folder
</code></pre>

<p>Create a symbolic link to a file:</p>

<pre><code>C:\temp\links&gt;mklink link4 file
symbolic link created for link4 &lt;&lt;===&gt;&gt; file
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>C:\temp\links&gt;dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is C021-6C9F

 Directory of C:\temp\links

09/05/2011  18:26    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
09/05/2011  18:26    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
09/05/2011  18:26                13 file
09/05/2011  18:25    &lt;SYMLINKD&gt;     link1 [folder]
09/05/2011  18:25    &lt;JUNCTION&gt;     link2 [C:\temp\links\folder]
09/05/2011  18:25    &lt;SYMLINK&gt;      link3 [folder]
09/05/2011  18:26    &lt;SYMLINK&gt;      link4 [file]
09/05/2011  18:23    &lt;DIR&gt;          folder
               3 File(s)             13 bytes
               5 Dir(s)  208,278,925,312 bytes free
</code></pre>

<p>Note the interesting types of files: <code>&lt;SYMLINKD&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;JUNCTION&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;SYMLINK&gt;</code>. The book says the first two are identical in functionality, simply <code>&lt;JUNCTION&gt;</code> is older mechanism available in older versions of Windows and supporting links within the same volume only.</p>

<p>Also, note that even <code>link3</code> points to a directory, it doesn&rsquo;t behave as a regular directory (in contrast to <code>link1</code> and <code>link2</code> which work normally as directories). FAR, by the way, also doesn&rsquo;t see <code>link3</code> as a directory.</p>

<p>In general, such simple task as links in the file system, solved in UNIX more than twenty years ago, has been solved in Windows in traditional for this operating system way - there are multiple solutions with different level of compatibility.</p>

<p>By the way, &ldquo;Windows Internals&rdquo; is bloody fantastic, strongly recommend.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just come across an interesting bug. Being executed from a Makefile script a unit test runner crashed. It looked like another memory corruption. But the consequence was more interesting. That Makefile kept going regardless the crash of the unit test runner. It means the runner still returned zero exit code instead of non-zero.</p>

<p>We fixed that bug (including Makefile problem) but a generic question occured: what exit code is returned to the parent when the process crashes before executing <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/exit">exit()</a>?</p>

<p>In UNIX there are special macros inspecting the status returned from <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/wait">wait()</a>. But all UNIXes are different and there is Windows as well.</p>

<p>Eventually I wrote a simple self-killing program:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite often people argue whether all those efforts to use unit tests are worth those benefits in code maintenance and regression bugs. Despite of many pros and cons being said there could be situations when it is not obvious that is better, but I can give a very representative example below.</p>

<p>At the moment I&rsquo;m working on a project customizing putty to support of-the-fly syntax highlighting for a proprietary programming language. The main difficulty is that the language has very complicated and not well defined and irregular grammar with lots of ambiguities.</p>

<p>As a result what I&rsquo;m doing is fixing different special cases here and there. But syntax highlighting is complicated in general - you fix one thing and easily break ten others at the same time.</p>

<p>After some time of maintenance I gave up and I spent a day setting up <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cmockery/">cmockery</a> and all the rest of unit testing plumbing. Then I remade all code examples I used to verify everything manually in a form of unit tests.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve done that life become simpler. Now after every change I can automatically check by running tests that all previous cases are not broken. I&rsquo;m confident to change things without being afraid of regression. Of course I spent an extra day to two developing, debugging and configuring unit tests infrastructure but it has paid off already, fully or even more.</p>

<p>Every new feature or bug fix I start from creating a test demonstrating how it should work, and, obviously, this test must fail. Then I implement a bit of functionality to make this test working. I cannot image how I might develop this project further without unit tests.</p>

<p>By the way, this is a classical approach when tests are written beforehand. And the main code complements the tests afterwards.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/03/27/common-misconceptions-about-plastic-bank-cards/"/>
    <updated>2011-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/03/27/common-misconceptions-about-plastic-bank-cards/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having more than ten years of experience working in banking, in particular with electronic payments, with the help of colleagues I&rsquo;ve created a mini FAQ about plastic bank cards. Some questions are obvious, but some can be quite vague.</p>

<p>Thus, there are ten common misconceptions.</p>

<p>1. The amount of money stored on the card.</p>

<p>On regular credit or debit cards (even having a chip) there is no money counter. The card is just an identifier. There are exceptions in the form of additional wallet applications on the chip cards. Usually it can be discount or loyalty programs, virtual money (for instance, petrol liters) etc. In general this is not related to the normal card usage. Such applications are usually accepted in special stores that only support these cards.</p>

<p>2. Anyone, who wants to accept the plastic cards, can be connected directly to Visa, MasterCard or to other international payment networks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not possible for just anyone to connect directly to Visa or MasterCard. Only major banks or independent processing centers can do it because it requires special equipment, considerable insurance accounts, security certification and lots of other &ldquo;little things&rdquo;. Furthermore not every bank can afford it. All others wishing to take cards use their services.</p>

<p>3\ ATMs or POS terminals are connected directly to Visa or MasterCard.</p>

<p>Major international payment networks do not have their own ATMs or payment terminals. ATMs or POS terminals must belong to a bank, which, in turn, is either directly or indirectly (see #2) connected to the payment network.</p>

<p>4. I have $200 &ldquo;on the card&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s all that I can spend.</p>

<p>The card balance and the amount you can spend daily using the card are not entirely related to each other. It is more constructive discussing the daily limit on the card. The daily limit depends on many factors, and can be either less than the card balance or even greater. For example, even having one million on the account, you may not be allowed to withdraw more than a few thousand in cash a day at the ATM (and this is not an ATM hardware limitation). And vice versa, if you are a VIP customer, usually having millions in the bank, but at the moment you&rsquo;ve lost everything in a casino, after the call to the bank, individually, some of the top managers can give the command to increase your daily limit allowing you to pay off. In this situation the bank takes all the responsibility that you will return everything back.</p>

<p>5. ATM or POS terminals validate the PIN.</p>

<p>In the overwhelming number of cases, any use of the card refers to a connection with the bank that issued the card. If you insert a card issued by HSBC UK in Australia, an approval to withdraw money will be requested from the HSBC UK anyway right before your eyes. This is because the PIN can be verified only by the bank that issued the card. The only exceptions are cards with a chip. Such cards can verify the PIN without connecting to the bank. These cards are microcomputers able to calculate crypto functions. Sometimes when making a purchase (not cash withdraw), a store may not connect to the bank when a non-chip card is being used if the amount is less than a certain limit. The reason for this is the transactional and communication costs. When the amount is not significant the risk of loss after possible fraud is also not significant.</p>

<p>6. The PIN is stored on the magnetic stripe and any bank or store employee can &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it when holding your card while you turn away.</p>

<p>In fact, there is only a crypto convolution of the PIN recorded on the magnetic stripe, and it is calculated using a crypto key stored in a bank HSM (high security module). Using data from the magnetic stripe can only verify the PIN, and only if you know the secret key. Usually the 3DES algorithm is used. HSM is a hardware device for storing keys and cryptographic operations using those keys. After initial input of keys to HSM (personalization) they are never sent outside the physical case of HSM in the plain form.</p>

<p>In addition to the major effort for the physical protection of these devices, they themselves are protected from an unauthorized intrusion. For example, if you try to open the case connecting a &ldquo;sniffer&rdquo;, all the keys will be automatically erased.</p>

<p>There is an interesting technique of primary keys input. For example, here is a realistic scenario. We choose N security officers of the bank, for example 3 (ideally, they shouldn&rsquo;t know each other personally). Each officer generates a key and doesn&rsquo;t show it to anyone else. Then, they in turn go into the room with HSM and enter their keys. After all the keys are entered, the HSM computes bitwise XOR amongst them and keeps the result as the master key. It turns out that nobody knows that master key at all. To restore the master key you have to know all original components from those N security officers, who must take care of keeping it secret.</p>

<p>There are no &ldquo;unimportant&rdquo; questions in the security, and such procedures are mandatory when the power of cryptography ends and the human factor starts.</p>

<p>This is very important: nobody from the bank staff, ever, under any circumstances will ask you the PIN. However, you cannot imagine how often countless customers, when being asked by the bank operator the security question say the PIN.</p>

<p>7. When making the purchase, money immediately comes directly from the customer&rsquo;s account to the account of the merchant.</p>

<p>Usually clearing happens in the end of the business day. When making the purchase the amount from the available day limit (see #4) is only taken on hold. The account is debited a few days later when the bank issued the card receives the financial representation from the bank that accepted the card and processed the payment (bank-acquirer).</p>

<p>8. The amount, printed on your receipt when paying by card, is precisely what will be deducted from your account.</p>

<p>In fact, the authorized amount may differ significantly from the amount that was withdrawn by the financial transaction. It often happens in car rentals and hotels. Such merchants are allowed to charge extras (for example, for petrol and minibar). And these are not the only type of merchants allowed to adjust the final amount.</p>

<p>Also the amount taken on hold on purchase and the amount eventually withdrawn from the account can differ if the account currency is different to the transaction currency. Clearing usually takes a few days but the exchange rate could change in this time.</p>

<p>9. The amount, taken on hold when paying by card, will be withdrawn from the account anyway.</p>

<p>The amount on hold may be never debited from the account. After 10 (for ATM) or 45 (for other types of terminals) days, if there is no financial representation received from the bank-acquirer, the hold will be lifted. This is &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. It is &ldquo;good&rdquo; if you have just paid but want to cancel. You can contact your bank immediately, explain the reason for the cancellation, and if everything is okay with the payment, the operator cancels the transaction and the hold disappears. In this case if your bank receives a financial representation of this payment from the merchant (in a few days period) the bank will be dealing with this problem without you (and your money). It is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; if you waited a couple of days and the financial representation has been delivered before your call. In this case it will be much harder to cancel the transaction and get your money back. The bank will have to start an investigation, which can take up to 45 days. Meanwhile that amount will still be on hold.</p>

<p>10. Debit card users cannot go to overdraft.</p>

<p>As explained in #4, the purchase authorization logic is not based on the account balance, but on the daily limits. And it works similarly for debit and credit cards. The bank can adjust the daily limit, slightly exceeding the account balance, even for debit cards.</p>

<p>Hope all this information will help you avoid some unpleasant surprises when using plastic cards.</p>

    <updated>2011-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/02/23/microxp/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The problem &ndash; a need to connect to a remote network via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>. To establish such connection, special software must be installed on a client workstation to create an encrypted tunnel between the workstation and the remote network. When that software is up and running, any application (telnet/ssh, ftp, radmin etc), including RDP client (mstsc.exe), might access to the remote network.</p>

<p>Not a problem when a client workstation runs Windows. You just go to a web site and logon, and then an ActiveX component gets started from the page, installs and runs everything required.</p>

<p>It becomes complicated if the workstation is not Windows. Indeed, there are RDP clients available for Linux and Mac, but it doesn&rsquo;t help much because without that encrypted channel it just doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning.</p>

<p>What do Linux and Mac users have to do? Install Windows in a virtual machine and run RDP in there. This is a good solution but with a drawback. A virtual machine hosting standard Windows usually takes a few gigabytes minimum and boots considerably slow.</p>

<p>I googled a bit and found <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=MicroXP-0.82.iso">MicroXP</a>. This is a very stripped-down version of XP SP3. The distribution ISO takes around ~100 MB, and when installed ~250. In VirtualBox on Mac Air the installation lasts five minutes and the already installed system boots in 10 seconds or less. The virtual machine requirements are minimal &ndash; a dynamic 300 MB disk and 64 MB of RAM.</p>

<p>After the installation of MicroXP you have to add Virtual Box Guest Additions (~200 KB) to share directories and not to struggle with the mouse, and then add a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=RemoteDesktop-MicroXp-0.82.zip">RDP client</a> (it can be transferred to the VM via the shared folders).</p>

<p>In summary, if you need minimalistic and fast XP, MicroXP is a very good candidate.</p>

<p>P.S. Don&rsquo;t visit microxp.org. This is a fake to fish e-mails.</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/02/16/norcpu-hacking-challenge-analisys-and-solutions/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Publishing the <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/02/08/norcpu-hackme-challenge/">announcement of the problem to hack</a> a program running on the CPU executing just one single command, I hoped to get a solution to the end of March, not earlier.</p>

<p>Note: Quoted materials below are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; in the original author edition. Only minor formatting changes are applied. Of course, the texts on Russian are translated to English.</p>

<p>But the reality was different. Literally a few hours after the announcement, I received an e-mail from <strong>Vasiliy Artemev</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secret code: 139471</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was the correct answer. Vasiliy was a winner and received the 100$ prize. He kindly shared that he bruteforced the problem. In fact, a simple bruteforce attach forced the program printing out the magic message even on a 3-character attempt. Alas, my hash function used to check the password had many collisions and become a weak link.</p>

<p>But there was no complete analysis of the password checking algorithm, and Vasiliy offered to sponsor the rest of the challenge to figure out the algorithm with 50$ from his prize. The challenge kept going.</p>

<p>In meanwhile I wrote the <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/norcpu/challenge/norcpu2.html">second version of the problem</a> without hashing but just an encrypted password. I hoped this makes the analysis harder. But in the same day evening I received an e-mail from <strong>Anton Bukov</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Answer for NORCPU hackme challenge, Version 2: &ldquo;R0und2 D0ne!&rdquo; ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the correct one. I wondered how is it possible to figure out so quickly?</p>

<p>Anton also shared his approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My hack is based on the line:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>mem = mem_0.slice(0);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>An array gets copied here, and if you call <code>calc()</code> function twice on the same array, then for any incorrect password it will print out the answer. In code it looked as:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>wcout &lt;&lt; calc(L&quot;0&quot;) &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; calc(L&quot;0&quot;) &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess that copying was used to prevent it. I&rsquo;m afraid this is not the way you expected. Even I was surprised when got the answer in the output. Afterwards I figured out where it appeared from.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accidentally Anton discovered a bug causing the program itself to reveal the secret, again. It needed just to run the interpreter twice without resetting memory.</p>

<p>The root of the problem:</p>

<pre class="hl">
...
  IS_0<span class="hl opt">(</span>flag<span class="hl opt">)</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">JZ</span> okay
  EXIT<span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">)</span>
<span class="hl kwc">okay:</span>
  <span class="hl slc">; print the secret</span>
  ...
</pre>

<p>After the first wrong run and refusing to print out the secret the program has stopped at the line 4, the <code>ip</code> register points to the <code>okay</code> label. If the interpreter gets started again without resetting memory (all registers including <code>ip</code> reside in memory), it keeps executing right from the <code>okay</code> and prints out the secret.</p>

<p>It was a shame. I fixed the problem quickly and released the version 2.1 without this side effect.</p>

<p>A couple of days left.</p>

<p>I received an e-mail from a guy with <strong>a5b</strong> nickname.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hot-patch of branching and the answer pw: <code>abcd</code> resp: <code>R0und2 D0ne!</code></p>

<ul>
<li>the password, obviously, is incorrect</li>
<li>inverted data being written to <code>(i == 27692 i==31712)</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Formally, this is the solution, but there is no password which means the algorithm is not analysed so far.</p>

<p>But after an hour I received an addendum:</p>

<pre><code>h1cKmE1fUsAn

input data:
chr conI LEET xor
CHR1 13417 13313 104 h

static init:
CHRi 59609= 59651
CONi 59610= 59634
CNTR 59611=12
SUM 59608=0
LEET 59607 = 13313

1:
[59609]+1 -&gt; [59609] // select next chr
[59610]+1 -&gt; [59610] // select next con

SUM |= CHRi ^ LEET ^ CONi
LEET = LEET * 3 + 29

[59611]: if([59611] != 0) Loop 1

...
if(SUM != 0) exit
else print R0und2 D0ne // haven't analysed this part.
// Based on the code modifications (moving the index), it loads 12 constants:
// 29528 22899 2971 9089 27542 17353 52278 25635 11626 34909 39131 51838,
// deals with each one and prints out.
</code></pre>

<p>This is the solution now. <strong>a5b</strong> became the first one who sent the algorithm of the <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/norcpu/challenge/norcpu2.html">problem 2</a>.</p>

<p>In the same evening I received a solution from <strong>Max Filippov</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>so that I got a long line (about 8Mb) of primitive instruction execution trace.</p>

<p>Then I started constructing sed script that would make it readable.</p>

<p>First, it broke the trace linewise, one instruction per line (288323 lines, will read it in case of insomnia). I took a look at processed trace and recorded several obvious instruction patterns into sed. Then reran script, took next look, recorded more patterns, &hellip;</p>

<p>This way I figured out all boolean logic commands and jumps. Then rotations left. Each time new command got recognized, new filtered processed trace was suggesting next step, e.g. 15 ROTL equals ROTR etc.</p>

<p>Then I looked into <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2010/04/06/modelling-a-cpu-with-only-one-operation/">your article</a>. And found addition pattern in disassembly. And recorded it in sed script.</p>

<p>After that I was able to just read the trace (which shrink to 1035 lines). Its inner loop fit into one page, I just made some notes on a scratchpad:</p>

    <updated>2011-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2011/02/08/norcpu-hackme-challenge/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Different kinds of &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; programming is quite popular among problem solvers. Sometimes it&rsquo;s even impossible to write code manually anymore for just another &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; programming environment. You have to write a code generator to create even a trivial program.</p>

<p>In the environment I&rsquo;m describing here you can easily write code manually on the high level macro assembler.</p>

<p>Okay, here is a virtual processor understanding only one logical command - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_NOR">Peirce arrow</a>.</p>

<p>A program written for this processor expects a password as an input. If the password is incorrect, it print out &ldquo;Wrong password!&rdquo;. Otherwise the special magic message will be printed.</p>

<p>The problem statement: You have to find out that magic message using any approach. For example, you can guess the password, the program will just print the secret out.</p>

<p>The logic is written such way that knowing the algorithm allows restoring the magic message without any problems.</p>

<p>Some time ago I <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2010/04/06/modelling-a-cpu-with-only-one-operation/">described this approach</a> in all details.</p>

<p>The original approach I used in this experiment, wasn&rsquo;t 100% &ldquo;clear&rdquo;, because the addition command was implemented outside the processor. In this implementation everything works inside the processor. It required modifying the interpreter slightly introducing a shift register.</p>

<p>For those who want to try to hack this problem, I&rsquo;ve created a web page containing an implementation of this one-command processor and the programming check the password.</p>

<p>Here you go - <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/norcpu/challenge/norcpu.html">the challenge</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. The first one solved the problem will get a little prize! Information is on the page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Do you watch screencasts?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve discovered this way of getting technical information for myself only recently. Impression is only positive so far - the perceptual speed is much faster comparing to reading.</p>

<p>For example, after <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-bdobjc/coding-in-objective-c-2-0">Coding in Objective-C 2.0</a> I can write a program in this language using classes and have an idea how the memory management works in Objective-C (by the way, it&rsquo;s quite interesting concept - a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; garbage collector when memory is freed automatically but the programmer has to manage the counter of active links to an object by himself.</p>

<p>Currently watching <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-bdiphone/writing-your-first-iphone-application">Writing Your First iPhone Application</a> and the next is <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">Erlang in Practice</a>.</p>

<p>This is a delicate moment with screencasts - it should be made qualitatively. Otherwise it&rsquo;s waste of time.</p>

<p>Which screencasts do you watch? What can you recommend?</p>

<p>P.S. By the way, I like <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">The pragmatic Bookshelf</a> online store more and more. All books are in multiple DRM free formats (pdf, mobi, epub).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When writing getter and setter methods in standard C++ there are three main approaches for naming.</p>

<p>1. Pure C++ method based on the references.</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Foo <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  Value field_<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">() {</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> field_<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">const</span> Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">()</span> <span class="hl kwb">const</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> field_<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class="hl">
Foo foo<span class="hl opt">;</span>
foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">() =</span> field_instance<span class="hl opt">;</span>
field_instance <span class="hl opt">=</span> foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
</pre>

<p>Pros: brevity, closeness to the property notation and possibility of using in a cascade assignment (<code>foo1.field() = foo2.field() = 2;</code>).</p>

<p>Cons: using the function call on the left looks unusual.</p>

<p>2. Java way</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Foo <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  Value field_<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">setField</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const</span> Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> value<span class="hl opt">) {</span> field_ <span class="hl opt">=</span> value<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">const</span> Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl kwd">getField</span><span class="hl opt">()</span> <span class="hl kwb">const</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> field_<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class="hl">
Foo foo<span class="hl opt">;</span>
foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">setField</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>field_instance<span class="hl opt">);</span>
field_instance <span class="hl opt">=</span> foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">getField</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
</pre>

<p>Pros: clarity and obviousness.</p>

<p>Cons: wordiness due to <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> prefixes.</p>

<p>3. Objective-C way</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Foo <span class="hl opt">{</span>
  Value field_<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">void</span> <span class="hl kwd">setField</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">const</span> Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> value<span class="hl opt">) {</span> field_ <span class="hl opt">=</span> value<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">const</span> Value<span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">()</span> <span class="hl kwb">const</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> field_<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre class="hl">
Foo foo<span class="hl opt">;</span>
foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">setField</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>field_instance<span class="hl opt">);</span>
field_instance <span class="hl opt">=</span> foo<span class="hl opt">.</span><span class="hl kwd">field</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
</pre>

<p>Pros: brevity (no useless <code>get</code> prefix) and clarify.</p>

<p>Cons: haven&rsquo;t found so far.</p>

<p>All three have rights to live but from the style perspective it&rsquo;s good to be consistent and use only one style across one project.</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2010/04/06/modelling-a-cpu-with-only-one-operation/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Going further with bitwise tips and tricks I will tell about a model of a CPU based on a single operation - NOR (or Peirce arrow).</p>

<p>In the mid-nineties in the FIDO discussion group RU.HACKER I come across an interesting hackme.</p>

<p>Usually &ldquo;hackme&rdquo; is an application which is published as a challenge to be hacked. It prompts for a password and the goal is to crack it. You may guess the password disassembling the code or could just patch the code and disable the password check and so on.</p>

<p>That &ldquo;hackme&rdquo; from RU.HACKER was originally written by famous Russian hacker and security expert Alexander Peslyak (the author of John The Ripper John The Ripper and Openwall Linux).</p>

<p>Unlike other &ldquo;hackme&rdquo; around Alexander&rsquo;s approach didn&rsquo;t have any anti-debugger tricks at all preventing disassembling and tracing. Furthermore it contained less then hundred bytes of x86 code. The code executed a trivial loop calculating only one operation - NOR (Pierce arrow). And the entire business logic (interaction with the console and password calculations) was build on top this primitive. Effectively this is a model of CPU having only one command.</p>

<p>The memory model of this CPU is flat and it consists of 16-bit words. The address space is from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF. A CPU instruction has 3 operands. There is no an instruction code because the command is always the same - NOR. Each operand represents an address.</p>

<p>To execute an instruction CPU takes the left argument of NOR from an address given in the first operand and the right argument from an address given in the second operand. Then it implies bitwise 16-bit NOR between them and puts the result to the address given in the third argument. Afterwards the instruction pointer is increment by 3 to shift to the next instruction and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>The instruction pointer (<code>IP</code>) is also located in the address space and JUMP operation could be implemented just by putting a jump address to the memory location of <code>IP</code>.</p>

<p>The original NOR interpreter was written on x86 assembly:</p>

<pre class="hl">

<p>Nothing prevents to write it on any language, for example, Python.</p>

    mem<span class="hl opt">[</span>r<span class="hl opt">] =</span> f
</pre>

<p>Why NOR? The Boolean algebra theory says that any of 14 of 16 Boolean functions could be calculated using just the rest two - NOR and NAND. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>NOT(a) = NOR(a, a)
AND(a, b) = NOT(OR(NOT(a), NOT(b)))
OR(a, b) = NOT(NOR(a, b))
XOR(a, b) = OR(AND(a, NOT(b)), AND(NOT(a), b)))
</code></pre>

<p>The move operation <code>MOVE(src, dst)</code> could be implemented via <code>OR</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mem[dst] = OR(mem[src], mem[src])
</code></pre>

<p>A conditional jump is either implemented via Boolean functions. If <code>cond</code> equals 0xFFFF (true), the jump to <code>addr</code> is performed. If <code>cond</code> equals 0x0000 (false) CPU sequentially takes the next instruction following <code>JUMP</code>.</p>

<pre><code>mem[IP] = OR(AND(addr, cond), AND(mem[IP], cond))
</code></pre>

<p>Or in the NOR interpreter notation:</p>

<pre><code>AND addr, cond, @t1
AND IP, cond, @t2
OR @t1, @t2, IP
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>@t1</code> and <code>@t2</code> are temporary variables. The <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> commands will be also expanded to sets of NORs as shown above.</p>

<p>Eventually we have Boolean functions, copy/move, unconditional and conditional jumps. We just lack the addition/subtraction and shifts. Having that we could implement the subroutine stack and then any complex computations can be made by this primitive CPU.</p>

<p>The original Alexander&rsquo;s NOR CPU implementation had a workaround which allows running the native x86 code. The workaround was based on the fact that the NOR interpreter also resides in its address space and can modify itself. To execute the native code a special high level macro (let&rsquo;s say emCallX86) uses MOVE operation (see above) to place two bytes at the beginning of the interpreter code (effectively it saves the original two bytes and put other two instead). Those two new bytes are an x86 short jump instruction. When the interpreter begins the next cycle it simply jumps out to an arbitrary x86 code. In the end the native code restores the original two bytes of the interpreter and returns the execution flow to it.</p>

<p>An interaction with DOS I/O and an addition of two 16-bit integers with carry were implemented in native code.</p>

<p>Frankly speaking I don&rsquo;t find it feasible to implement a full 16-bit adder using Boolean functions only. The original NOR interpreter only performed bitwise NOR. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to move/shift an individual bit to another one but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)">full binary adder</a> needs it to consider the carry.</p>

<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve come back to this NOR interpreter approach but in Python world. I&rsquo;ve modified the original idea a bit to simplify (or just make it possible) an implementation of addition using NOR only, without native code at all. I&rsquo;ve introduced one extra operation in the interpreter ñ the result of NOR is cyclically shifted left by 1 bit and stored the special location in memory.</p>

</pre>

<p>There are two special locations now: <code>IP</code> (instruction pointer) and <code>S</code> (shift register).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to implement the full addition of 16-bit words with carry. I will use a simple macro assembler.</p>

<p>The full 1 bit adder formulas are:</p>

<pre><code>sum = (a ^ b) ^ carry
carry = (a &amp; b) | (carry &amp; (a ^ b))
</code></pre>

<p>Now in the NOR CPU assembly:</p>

<pre><code>; Input:
;  mask  - a current bit mask (0x0001, 0x0002, 0x0004, 0x0008 etc)
;  carry ñ a carry from the previous bit (the masked applied)
;  a, b  - an argument addresses
;  r     - an address of the result
; Output:
;  r     - a result
;  carry - a carry to the next bit (already left shifted with respect to the mask)
;  mask  - a mask left shifted by one bit
;
; Variables with '@' prefix are local for the macro.
;
!macro FADD mask, carry, a, b, r
  XOR a, b, @t1              ; Formula: sum = (a ^ b) ^ carry.
  XOR @t1, carry, @bit_r     ; 
  AND @bit_r, mask, @bit_r   ; Mask all bits in @bit_r expect the current one
  OR @bit_r, r, r            ; Save the bit to the result: r |= sum
  AND a, b, @t2              ; Formula: carry = (a &amp; b) | (carry &amp; (a ^ b))
  AND carry, @t1, @t1        ;
  OR @t2, @t1, carry         ; The carry is calculated. Its left shifted copy is in S. 
  MOVE S, carry              ; Assign the carry to itself but shifted the next bit.
  MOVE mask, mask, mask      ; Dummy assignment to just get: S = mask &lt;&lt; 1.
  MOVE S, mask               ; mask = S = mask &lt;&lt; 1
</code></pre>

<p>Then we implement the 16-bit adder:</p>

<pre><code>; Input:
;  a, b  - argument
;  carry ñ a carry (the least significant bit only makes sense)
; Output:
;  r     - the result: r = a + c + carry
;  carry ñ a carry (the least significant bit only makes sense)
;
; Variables having '@' prefix are local for the macro.
; const_1 - a special location containing the constant 0x0001.
;
!macro ADC a, b, carry, r
  XOR r, r, r                     ; r = 0.
  MOVE const_1, @mask             ; The initial mask value = 0x0001
  *16 FADD @mask, carry, a, b, r  ; Repeat FADD 16 times (no loops, just a
                                  ; repetition)
  AND carry, const_1, carry       ; Clean-up all bits in carry except LSB.
</code></pre>

<p>What happens in <code>ADC</code>? On each iteration (repetition) of <code>FADD</code> it sums the current bit (its mask is <code>@mask</code>). Then the sum is joined (via <code>OR</code>) with the result. The mask is shifted to left 1 bit (the <code>@mask</code> takes values 0x0001 -&gt; 0x0002 -&gt; 0x0004 etc). The carry is also shifted to the left 1 bit to be used on the next iteration of <code>FADD</code>. After 16 iterations the carry will be in LSB (because the interpreter shifts cyclically). The carry after 16 iterations will be output value of carry.</p>

<p>The addition is implemented eventually. Then we could programmatically implement a subroutine stack. <code>CALL</code>/<code>RET</code> instructions could be based on the stack mechanism and branching instructions.</p>

<p>Now we can easily do any computations on our pseudo CPU executing only one command.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the point of all this stuff? First of all is an academic interest, fun.</p>

<p>This one looks very cool and hackish but unfortinatelly may cause an unpredictable behavior according to the Standard due to the chained assignments. So the last edition is also fast and overflow free but doesn&rsquo;t have an unpredictable behavior:</p>

<p>But how fast is this?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve compared it against implementations in C++ and C.</p>

<p>The first competitor is Go using <code>bool</code> type in as a storage (see above). The second one is the also Go&rsquo;s version but with <code>int</code> as the storage type.</p>

<p>Run:</p>

<p>Output:</p>

<p>C++ using <code>std::vector&lt;book&gt;</code> has beaten C and Go. The second is Go&rsquo;s implementation also using <code>bool</code>. And on the third place are C, C++ with <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code> and Go with <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>A condition in the loop solves the problem, it&rsquo;s better to iterate containers using manipulators:</p>

<pre class="hl">

<p>It&rsquo;s not also great because iterators of some containers don&rsquo;t support subtraction. For example, this code doesn&rsquo;t compile if we use <code>std::list</code> instead of <code>std::vector</code> (the first example also fails on <code>std::list</code> but due to another reason). The better way is:</p>

<p>The <code>std::distance</code> template can calculate the distance between two iterators even if they don&rsquo;t support arithmetics. But for this kind of containers <code>std::distance</code> just iterates from one to another and the overall time of the print loop seems to be <code>O(N^2)</code> instead of original <code>O(N)</code>. Also we have to use the type name twice — to declare the iterator and to instantiate <code>std::distance</code>. For example, Visual Studio 2008 cannot deduct the type from the parameters of <code>std::distance</code>.</p>

<p>There is another neat way allowing to use iterators (with <code>O(N)</code> time even for containers such as <code>std::list</code>), and to write beautifully and compactly:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;vector&gt;</span>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/12/16/cpp-common-knowledge/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to the <a href="http://semantics.org/instructorbio.html">Steve Dewhurst</a>&rsquo;s training &ldquo;<a href="http://semantics.org/courses/Cpp-Common-Knowledge-Training.html">C++ Common Knowledge course</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been having his book quite a long time:</p>

<p>Stephen Dewhurst, &ldquo;C++ Common Knowledge&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321321928/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0321321928"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0321321928&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0321321928" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>and in general, this training is specifically focused on the topics from it.</p>

<p>Very cool man. It was interesting and accompanied with jokes like that Boost guys just smoke templates etc. I really liked it.</p>

<p>Steve said that C++ is virtually the most that is doing in life. He wrote the compilers, utilities, versed in the standards and now he provides trainings.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I learned something very new - it would be strange since I read his book above from cover to cover and periodically get back to it. Although perhaps one thought I was hooked: the correct implementation of the copy constructor or assignment operator for the class in the hierarchy with a virtual base class having data members is a very complicated task. This clearly violates the principle of independence of the logical levels in the hierarchy of inheritance, as it necessary requires to know exactly from which classes you inherited and how to properly initialize them with multiple inheritance.</p>

<p>The recommendation is as follows: first ask yourself a question: do I need a multiple inheritance here? do I need a virtual multiple inheritance?? but do I need a virtual multiple inheritance with the data in the virtual base class??? And even after long reflection it&rsquo;s better to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Personally I don&rsquo;t have anything against the multiple inheritance. But I don&rsquo;t really like how it&rsquo;s implemented in C++. And I don&rsquo;t really like how it&rsquo;s done in Java either. I do like how it&rsquo;s done in Go. In Go the notions of data structures and interfaces are completely separated. Data structures cannot be inherited. They can only implement interfaces. And you can inherit only an interface. Therefore, in principle, it isn&rsquo;t possible to pick up other people&rsquo;s data in inheritance but only methods. And no data, no problem in its initialization.</p>

<p>So I just summarize the general recommendations from Steve:</p>

<ul>
<li>try to use virtual functions and polymorphism in general instead of &ldquo;if&rdquo; and &ldquo;case&rdquo;</li>
<li>try to use the STL/Boost algorithms and functors instead of loops</li>
<li>use only &ldquo;smart&rdquo; pointers when working with dynamic memory</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t use the classical arrays but STL containers (as for example, std::vector guarantees the linear arrangement of elements, it&rsquo;s possible to mix the &ldquo;old&rdquo; code that works with pointers with using containers)</li>
<li>think carefully about copying operations of complex classes (the best way to implement a copy constructor and the swap method, and implement the assignment operator through them)</li>
<li>always declare the copy constructor and assignment operator, and even if they are not used just simply comment out them with a brief explanation why they are not needed</li>
<li>never use C-like casts, and only C++-like (static_cast, const_cast, etc.), as they are long, tedious to fill and they distort the view of program - in short everything you need to minimize their presence</li>
<li>remember that an inheritance - a re-use of interfaces but not code itself</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t the compiler too much ;-) (Steve wrote them and knows that they may hit your back)</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Slowly finished reading &ldquo;Coders at Work&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Peter Seibel, &ldquo;Coders at Work&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1430219483/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1430219483"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=1430219483&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1430219483" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>The book consists of interviews with a dozen well-known programmers. Here are creators of UNIX, Netscape, JavaScript, Smalltalk, Haskell, Erlang, Ghostscript, LJ and also merely Donald Knuth.</p>

<p>The author asks them similar questions: when and why you started programming, how you usually work, where and on what you have worked and are working now, what do you think about the development of programming languages over the past decade, what you can advise the young etc. Some memoirs theme is dangerous because you can slip into elementary senile grumbling like &ldquo;but at our times&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better write in machine language and it&rsquo;ll teach you more&hellip;&rdquo;, but all proved to have very balanced view of reality. Of course, there is a radical separation between functional and imperative fans but this is the question of religion rather than age.</p>

<p>Many refer to various books - I have expanded much my &ldquo;must read&rdquo; list.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny that almost no one answered unequivocally positive about C++. They were like &ldquo;very hard, difficult etc&rdquo; or &ldquo;well, now that more than anything so far there is no better than to build native code of industrial complexity, let him be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lyrical digression. I&rsquo;ve been smoking Go and it takes me off deeper and deeper. I can say that I have almost found all of my C++ habits in Go. And its innate multi threading and ultra-fast compile polish everything.</p>

<p>Also there is an interesting opinion on whether it&rsquo;s required for all self-respecting programmers to read the &ldquo;Art of Computer Programming&rdquo; Knuth, or at least have in the library. Many recognized that they didn&rsquo;t read from cover to cover, but used as a reference.</p>

<p>As always I&rsquo;ve got that I did not even have heard of some very famous things. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate programming</a> from Donald Knuth or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>.</p>

<p>In general, I&rsquo;ve found the book very interesting. If you are longing covers like &ldquo;should I program the entire career&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;should I shift to management or architects because young is pressing from the back&hellip;&rdquo;. Here is given an excellent, but the hidden answer: any of these ways can bring and satisfaction and, importantly, wealth. That&rsquo;s the beauty of our profession. Just do the thing that you want to work till night, look around wondering what&rsquo;s going on and not worry that you can be unnecessary - you can&rsquo;t.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work I am involved in the following routine: there is a branch of sources which stability is monstrously important. Not even saying about breaking the build every commit goes through a few stages of automated checks (compiling by several compilers on several platforms, running through a variety of analyzer etc). Then it has to be approved at least by four/five people who take the responsibility of the commit. The routine is quite painful and long even from a technical point of view. On top of it the procedure is lined up over the years and based on very old SCM and we will not it&rsquo;s called in vain. Therefore the possibility of merging and conflict resolution is manual mostly. It can normally do only check-out and check-in.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the fact that every commit is prepared, debugged and tested a sizable time (the benefit is that there are bug fixes only which are typically small) and even formal aspect of an issue may take a couple of days, often happens that when it comes directly to the command &ldquo;commit&rdquo; all ends up with a conflict because someone has already managed to touch a piece of your code and pour it on the server. Then it needs to merge manually. And if the file is not one then a headache begins.</p>

<p>Since I am only recently involved in this stuff after the second commit I&rsquo;ve decided to simplify my life in terms of merging on a conflict.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got the <a href="http://git-scm.org/">git</a> and now it looks this way: each bug fix lives in the separate git&rsquo;s repository (in fact, in a directory) with two main branches. In one I do patching and preserve entire history of it in git, and periodically I sync the second branch with the main repository. And if I&rsquo;ve got new just synced changes in the second branch I merge the first one with it using just one magic command <code>git merge</code>.</p>

<p>In terms of distributed SCMs I now mostly with the mercurial because Google Code supports it. But frankly speaking the git is extremely powerful tool (of course if Windows is not involved in the workflow because git&rsquo;s Windows port is horrible).</p>

<p>At the beginning of using git there is lots of confusion. Personally I was absolutely misleading by the idea of the staging area (or the index). This is an intermediate chain between local files and the repository. So <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a> can show the three different things: the diff between the local files and the index (but not the repository as many people expect by default and it introduces git&rsquo;s newcomers to a screeching halt), the diff between the index and the repository and finally the diff between the local files and the repository. The index (or the staging area) allows to commit changed files selectively. Usually a commit affects only staged files (in the index). And the most interesting it is possible to stage (and eventually to commit) files partially. For example, I&rsquo;ve added two brand new classes to a file but I am able to commit only one and commit the next one later.</p>

<p>Do you already like it?</p>

<p>For example, a rollback of all local changes could be done at least two ways (using <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html">git checkout</a> or via <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html">git reset</a>). Also to rollback of already committed change you also have as minimum two alternatives (<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-reset.html">git reset</a> или <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-revert.html">git revert</a>) depending on your wish to make this rollback visible in the history.</p>

<p>The abundance of features and some of their dissimilarity to the generally accepted standards of SCM commands is a little daunting at the beginning. But after a while you get started to feel the git&rsquo;s power. For example, having the staging area and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-stash.html">git stash</a> (when possible to freeze the state of local changes, do some quick hacking and then get that state back) are very unique features of git.</p>

<p>In terms of GUI the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitk.html">gitk</a> provides all the necessary.</p>

<p>The only thing that you need to choose on taste alone is program for merging in a graphical mode to resolve conflicts. Here all are in their preferences.</p>

<p>I would recommend a very good book to start with git.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356158/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1934356158"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=1934356158&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1934356158" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<p>This is the very good introduction into Git from the community of Linux kernel developers and from Linux Torvalds in particular.</p>

<p>I appreciate these books for primary involvement in the subject.</p>

<p>This is a book for beginners, and if you&rsquo;re not a novice in the field of DVCS, then you swallow it in one evening and want a more in-depth knowledge of Git. It happened to me. I read the book for the evening, it formulated dozens of unanswered questions and allowed me to understand - what kind of questions I need answers for.</p>

<p>You will find the excellent <a href="http://book.git-scm.com/">live book about Git</a> on the official website. Many chapters are accompanied with video tutorials.</p>

<p>I usually do not keep the book for beginners because after you are interested in the subject any more or dig deeper and knowledge for beginners becomes useless. But I leave this one.</p>

<p>Using right and convenient tools greatly speeds work. And the time spent at the beginning to choice and to set up them definitely pays off in the future.</p>

<p>Hope I was able to attract into the ranks of git users a few more enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Once accustomed to the constant presence on hand a version control, you want it to be everywhere. Even when repairing a car.</p>

<p>I could send it off to all interested in the order of requests. Naturally it is relevant only if you have a Gmail account. So please please indicate an address at Gmail to send the invitation.</p>

<p>Please be patient because after the invitation is sent it could take a couple of days until you get it.</p>

<p>And one more thing &ndash; share your own invitations because Wave is cool where there are many people in it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In spare time I have been slowly, savouring and gladly working on <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/10/02/radio86rk-emulator-in-javascript/">the emulator in JavaScript of the vintage 8-bit computer Radio-86RK</a>.</p>

<p>Just as in the good old days but now it <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">works in a browser</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/rk.gif" /></p>

<p>The latest version is 0.6. Apart from the emulation there are the built-in assembler to write and compiler a code for Intel 8080 directly in the window of the emulator, and the almost interactive disassembler to view not only a code but also data.</p>

<p>A few screenshots (click-able):</p>

<p>Disassembler:</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/radio86-disassembler-chess.png" /></p>

<p>The list of games is also being updated.</p>

<p>I do support only Chrome really but they say it also works in Firefox and Safari with more or less of little glitches.</p>

<p>It is difficult to explain my fun from this project. This is something deep inside.</p>

    <updated>2009-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/10/29/artificial-typification-of-homogeneous-arguments-in-cpp/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&rsquo;s say there is a class with following interface:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Date <span class="hl opt">{</span>
 <span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">Date</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> year<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> month<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> day<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
    <span class="hl opt">...</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately not everybody in the world uses the same quite logical notation of Year/Month/Day or Day/Month/Year. Some people prefer Month/Day/Year. But even the first two could be easily mixed up. If the following is written:</p>

<pre class="hl">
Data <span class="hl kwd">d</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">2009</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">4</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">5</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
</pre>

<p>Is it 4th of May or 5th of April? Who can be entirely sure what it exactly means without looking in the class declaration?</p>

<p>Any chance to improve the design? Indeed.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Year <span class="hl opt">{</span>
 <span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwc">explicit</span> <span class="hl kwd">Year</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> year<span class="hl opt">) :</span> <span class="hl kwd">year_</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>year<span class="hl opt">) {}</span>
  <span class="hl kwc">operator</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span><span class="hl opt">()</span> <span class="hl kwb">const</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> year_<span class="hl opt">; }</span>
 <span class="hl kwc">private</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">int</span> year_<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>And similar for the rest:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Month <span class="hl opt">{ ... };</span>
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Day <span class="hl opt">{ ... };</span>
</pre>

<p>Now the interface could look this way:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwc">class</span> Date <span class="hl opt">{</span>
 <span class="hl kwc">public</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
   <span class="hl kwd">Date</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>Year year<span class="hl opt">,</span> Month month<span class="hl opt">,</span> Day day<span class="hl opt">);</span>
   <span class="hl kwd">Date</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>Month month<span class="hl opt">,</span> Day day<span class="hl opt">,</span> Year year<span class="hl opt">);</span>
   <span class="hl kwd">Date</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>Day day<span class="hl opt">,</span> Month month<span class="hl opt">,</span> Year year<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>We can instantiate the class as:</p>

<pre class="hl">
Date <span class="hl kwd">d</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwd">Year</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">2010</span><span class="hl opt">),</span> <span class="hl kwd">Month</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">4</span><span class="hl opt">),</span> <span class="hl kwd">Day</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">5</span><span class="hl opt">));</span>
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="hl">
Date <span class="hl kwd">d</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwd">Month</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">4</span><span class="hl opt">),</span> <span class="hl kwd">Day</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">5</span><span class="hl opt">),</span> <span class="hl kwd">Year</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">2010</span><span class="hl opt">));</span>
</pre>

<p>The result is always visible and fully predictable in a calling code. Everything will be inlined so no slow down involved at all because of those three &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; classes.</p>

<p>I agree there is more typing job but it fully gets you rid of any typos and consequently of silly but annoying bugs.</p>

<p>Any objections?</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/10/22/subtle-printf/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I&rsquo;d come across an interesting glitch which confused me for a while.</p>

<p>I was debugging a brand new online assembler for my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/radio86">Radio-86RK emulator</a>. That debugging meant some dancing around HTML.</p>

<p>To build a final HTML file from a bunch of tiny files I used a very simple program. Here is a bit of code from it:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl opt">...</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">while</span> <span class="hl opt">(!</span><span class="hl kwd">feof</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>f<span class="hl opt">)) {</span>
    <span class="hl kwb">char</span> line<span class="hl opt">[</span><span class="hl num">1024</span><span class="hl opt">];</span>
    <span class="hl opt">*</span>line <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
    <span class="hl kwd">fgets</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>line<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwa">sizeof</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>line<span class="hl opt">),</span> f<span class="hl opt">);</span>
    <span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>line<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span>
<span class="hl opt">...</span>
</pre>

<p>Implied that this code should copy all lines from a file <code>f</code> to the standard output.</p>

<p>Even if we don&rsquo;t care about using a buffer with a constant length and rest of other C-like features, this code has one serious drawback which embarrassed me for a quite awhile. It worked okay until I had started to play with percent widths and heights of HTML objects.</p>

<p>Instead of getting:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I was ending up with:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You have probably already guessed why. But to tell the truth I had been investigating this up to half an hour.</p>

<p>So instead of:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>line<span class="hl opt">);</span>
</pre>

<p>I had to write:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwd">printf</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl str">&quot;%s&quot;</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> line<span class="hl opt">);</span>
</pre>

<p>Otherwise all percentage characters are treated as formatters because the first parameter of <code>printf()</code> is a format and all non-escaped <code>%</code> characters will be deleted. That is what was happening to me.</p>

<p>Conclusion (following after the first one - &ldquo;serves you right&rdquo;): It is much safer to write in C++ and use STL streams for formatting.</p>

<p>I have come over today and see this:</p>

<p>There is a new item in the Source tab — Close (in red). This is what we have been waiting for a long time — project cloning.</p>

<p>If an owner of some project does not want to make you as a contributor but you are desperately keen to show off your work on the project, you can simply clone it and keep going to work on your own fork. Entire history of an original project will be fully inherited.</p>

<p>A clone can be cloned as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I keep going to spread out my projects on Google Code.</p>

<p>This bit is roughly one year old project — the remote control over Bluetooth for <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">Lego NXT</a> using the applet running on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve called it unpretentiously — <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nxtbtrc">nxtbtrc</a>.</p>

<p>Everything is simple. The Java applet running on a J2ME compatible phone pairs with Lego NXT brick and then sends commands to it. Nothing special but it was interesting to figure out how to use Bluetooth API in J2ME.</p>

<p>I am not sure about any further development but who knows — maybe it comes in handy for somebody.</p>

<p>Here is the small video demonstrating its work:</p>

<iframe width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/F0HW3Mth0Pw?color=white&theme=light"></iframe>

<p>I have even bought the book for this case. By the way the book is quite nice. It tells about Bluetooth from the programmer&rsquo;s point of view in a simple and clean manner. A few stacks of different vendors are covered, their comparison is given and accompanied with examples on different languages and platforms.</p>

    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/10/03/google-test-framework-140/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Googlers announced the next version of my favourite testing framework for C++ <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest">Google Testing Framework</a> - 1.4.0.</p>

<p>Any changes? Indeed.</p>

<p>The major feature coming is the &ldquo;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/GoogleTestAdvancedGuide#Extending_Google_Test_by_Handling_Test_Events">The event listener API</a>&rdquo;. In other words this is the way to customize the output produced by tests without any code changes in the library sources.</p>

<p>For example, the standard output of the trivial test (file <code>runner.cpp</code>):</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;gtest/gtest.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl kwd">TEST</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>One<span class="hl opt">,</span> Simple<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">EXPECT_EQ</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">2</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">char</span><span class="hl opt">**</span> argv<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl opt">::</span>testing<span class="hl opt">::</span><span class="hl kwd">InitGoogleTest</span><span class="hl opt">(&amp;</span>argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> argv<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl kwd">RUN_ALL_TESTS</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>is</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from One
[ RUN      ] One.Simple
runner.cpp(4): error: Value of: 2

</code></pre>

<p>To customize the output we have to implement our own event listener (for instance, file <code>runner.cpp)</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;gtest/gtest.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<p>Note that it could be several active listeners. But their output can be messed. Therefore we firstly remove the default listener from the list to avoid in influence on our listener&rsquo;s output.</p>

<span class="hl opt">};</span>
</pre>

<p>Also there is the brand new flag <code>--gtest_shuffle</code> allowing to run tests in a random order. Via <code>--gtest_random_seed=SEED</code> flag it becomes feasible to control the randomness of this order. If SEED is 0 the current time is used to initialize the random generator.</p>

<p>Reporting is going to be more compatible the JUnit. Using <code>--gtest_output</code> allows to generate reports which can be easily picked up JUnit compatible tools, for instance, Hudson.</p>

<p>Very cool that now in Visual Studio each failing test reports are duplicated to the standard &ldquo;Output&rdquo; window. It is very nice that this change is based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/detail?r=283">my code</a>.</p>

<p>In addition the <code>--gtest_print_time</code> option is turned on by default. Very handy.</p>

<p>There are also some minor improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>CodeGear support</li>
<li>internal <code>tuple</code> implementation getting rid of the boost dependency when <code>Compile()</code> is used</li>
<li>minor compatibility improvement for Solaris, Windows Mobile and some other platforms</li>
</ul>

<p>The joy, no doubt!</p>

<p>I have stopped to develop anything without tests long time ago and Google Test makes this process easier and faster.</p>

<p>I have already upgraded to the version 1.4.0, and you?</p>

    <updated>2009-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/10/02/radio86rk-emulator-in-javascript/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This post contains lots of information on Russian and links to resources on Russian. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s not possible to translate certain things like original 8-bit games output written ages ago or original screenshots. In this post I&rsquo;m mostly keen on emotions and memories when you see the machine given your basics right in a web browser and it is reconstructed bit by bit just in pure JavaScript.</em></p>

<p>The first computer I started programming on was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computer_hardware_in_Soviet_Bloc_countries#Radio-86RK">Radio-86RK</a>. My brother built it&hellip; and it got started and keeps going up to nowadays.</p>

<p>That is why I still have a tender affection for this little 8-bit piece of hardware. As the result of this affection I have been writing its emulators.</p>

<p>The first one was for DOS. I still keep its <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/radio86/emulator/dos/">original web site</a> without any changes. That emulator was quite powerful: the built-in debugger, the game cracking mechanism etc. But DOS time was over and now that emulator works properly only in <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a>. The sources are <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/radio86/emulator/dos/download.html">available for download</a>.</p>

<p>The next generation of dear RK was for Windows and based on <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>. But there was no the built-in debugger and the project itself seems to be unfinished but runnable and allowing to still play games. That is why its <a href="http://demin.ws/projects/radio86/emulator/windows/radio86-0.0.1.zip">binary only but accompanied with bunch of games</a> is available on public.</p>

<p>But a couple of days ago I have come across this - the <a href="http://matt.west.co.tt/spectrum/jsspeccy/">emulator of Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a> written on pure JavaScript (no applets, activex etc.)</p>

<p>I was impressed and inspired so after a day or two my old little RK monster has been born again and its new platform is JavaScript. It seems that proper browsers now already provide quite good JavaScript performance. 2D graphics are implemented via <code>canvas</code> HTML5 tag.</p>

<p>The project comes out as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/radio86/">Radio-86РК in JavaScript</a> (in Russian).</p>

<p>The emulator and games live in the one single file <a href="http://radio86.googlecode.com/hg/online/radio86.html">radio86.html</a>. By clicking on this link the emulator gets started right in a browser. There is the game selector at the bottom, and the possibility to play around with screen dimensions and speed.
Even if you do not understand Russian there is no problem at all. Just launch the emulator, select a game and try to play. Most of games use the arrows for movements and the space bar to shoot/jump/take/etc. You will definitely feel the spirit of those 8-bit B&amp;W dodgy games. Have a fun!</p>

<p>In general the emulation works on the Intel 8080 commands level.</p>

<p>Here is the screenshot of the classic game Volcano from the emulator.</p>

<p><img src="http://demin.ws/images/blog/radio86-volcano.png" /></p>

<p>At the moment I&rsquo;ve tested the emulator in the Google Chrome 4.* only. I&rsquo;m not quite keen about any compatibility with other browsers but let&rsquo;s see how it goes along. IE (even version 8) does not definitely handle it properly but Firefox and Opera could try.</p>

<p>The wonderful 8-bit world of Radio-86RK is coming back!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: Version 0.3 is released. It works much faster and does not thrash CPU anymore. Also I have included a few applications (interpreters, compilers, tools etc.)</p>

    <updated>2009-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/09/30/const-t-t-const/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not a secret that using <code>const T*</code> to declare a pointer is exactly the same to <code>T const*</code> because it&rsquo;s only important here to use <code>const</code> before <code>*</code> but the order of <code>T</code> and <code>const</code> doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>The both:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwb">const</span> T<span class="hl opt">*</span> p<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre class="hl">
T <span class="hl kwb">const</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> p<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

<p>declare the pointer <code>p</code> to a const object but not a const pointer. The pointer itself can be modified:</p>

<pre class="hl">
T <span class="hl kwb">const</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> p<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">...</span>
p <span class="hl opt">=</span> NULL<span class="hl opt">;</span>
</pre>

<p>But it&rsquo;s impossible to modify the object:</p>

<pre class="hl">
T <span class="hl kwb">const</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> p<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">...</span>
p<span class="hl opt">-&gt;</span>some_member <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>   <span class="hl slc">// ERROR: error C2166: l-value specifies const object</span>
</pre>

<p>This was the introductory and let&rsquo;s talk about the topic.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really keen to have readable sources. I could be wrong but in my opinion from the universal point of view using const at the beginning of an expression (for, instance, <code>const T* p;</code>) implies that the entire expression is <code>const</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter that in this particular case according to the C++ rules it means only that the object is <code>const</code> but not the pointer.</p>

<p>That is why <code>T const* p;</code> could be treated differently, notably &ldquo;a type <code>T</code> which is <code>const</code> and the pointer to this type&rdquo;. Readability becomes a bit better.</p>

<p>Of course, all these are questions of a coding style and it&rsquo;s always recommended to be consistent modifying existing sources. But if you&rsquo;re just learning or beginning a new project or something when it&rsquo;s feasible to try something fresh, it may worth not to refuse yourself in this experience.</p>

    <link href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/09/28/cross-platform-perforce-source-patcher/"/>
    <updated>2009-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://demin.ws/blog/english/2009/09/28/cross-platform-perforce-source-patcher/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible to imagine modern software development without using version control systems. There are quite a few players on the market - open sourced, proprietary and in between. One of the last ones is Perforce. This is a commercial product but it&rsquo;s available for personal home use. I work for the big software house in the UK and we intensively use Perforce as SCM backend. Perforce is quite handy and flexible SCM despite of a few minor problems but I would say in general these are conceptual issues which are coming from the different approaches I might have vs. Perforce authors on how the source version control should or should not be implemented.</p>

<p>For instance, the specifics of the development in our company are that we support and develop our products on many platforms such as Linux, SunOS, AIX, HP-UX, Tru64, Windows etc. Talking about platforms, even for UNIX family the development of portable software is quite a challenging problem. For example, multithreading and networking are not straightforward enough to be implemented portably right away. Every time a new piece of code or a patch is coming up it must be verified on all supported platforms starting from just compilation up to unit testing and QA.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Perforce is not quite flexible in this instance. Here is an example of the obvious development cycle: The piece of code is initially developed and tested on one machine, therefore any added, changed, deleted or integrated files are in the &ldquo;submit pending&rdquo; list on this machine. When the developer is about to check it in, unfortunately for him and fortunately for other team members, he must check his new code on other development boxes. Perforce does not provide the mechanism of the &ldquo;soft-submit&rdquo; or allow temporary check-in of the new code with subsequent check-out on another machine for testing purposes. This process also becomes really painful when the amount of the pending code is quite large, the number of machines where you have to check the code is also not just one or two, and on top of it the number of iterations for &ldquo;change-submit-check-revert&rdquo; is exceeding a few dozens per day.</p>

<p>The tool I am going to tell you about aims to salvage this issue. It allows transferring your current Perforce pending list from one development box to another in split second.</p>

<p>The following assumes that the reader is a bit familiar with using Perforce.</p>

<p>Of course a normal UNIX user will offer some kind of simple scripts to automate the process, which was my thinking initially as well. Unfortunately the scripting is not 100% portable due to so many different shells involved (ksh, bash, csh). If that wasn&rsquo;t enough unfortunately Windows &ldquo;scripting&rdquo; is also involved into the process, and its behaviour is far from UNIX way even with the use of Cygwin. My first version of the tool was written on Korn shell but it was not really portable between UNIX and Windows. The second version was written on Python and it would be just fine apart from Python not being easily available on all development boxes in case the development involves a little bit dodgy platforms such as HP-UX and AIX.</p>

<p>Finally I ended up with the third version completely rewritten on pure ANSI C. The final name is <code>p4p</code> (P4 Patcher). The idea is for the tool to be distributed in source and compiled on the target platform just before use. Also, the tool is targeted to provide maximum debugging and error related information on the runtime. It helps the end user (the developer) to fix the tool if it does not work properly on any particular platform. I have been successfully using the tool on Linux, SunOS, AIX, HP-UX and Windows. The most exciting thing is that I can easily transfer the pending change list between all these platforms.</p>

<p>I put the source to the Google Code - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/p4patch">p4patch</a> and it can be checked out from there. You will then have to compile and run it on other development machines.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s step away from the theory and look into something real. Let&rsquo;s assume you have a bunch of files ready to submit on your box. The Perforce <code>p4 opened</code> command shows that list.</p>

<p>Here is the crush course for your next steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the source <a href="http://code.google.com/p/p4patch/source/browse/p4p.c">p4p.c</a></li>
<li>Compile it under your platform (on a remote machine and on your local one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Linux, AIX, HP-UX:</p>

<pre><code>./compile-unix.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Solaris:</p>

<pre><code>./compile-solaris.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Windows:</p>

<pre><code>compile-vs2008.cmd
</code></pre>

<p>Run the p4patch server on the remote machine (e.q. 192.168.1.9):</p>

<pre><code>p4p server
</code></pre>

<p>Generate a patch archive on the local machine via <code>p4p diff</code> (<code>patch.tar</code> will be created). This command uses <code>p4 opened</code> to get the list of the files included into the patch and packs them into a TAR archive. The file list can be provided explicitly via <code>-o</code> option.</p>

<p>By <code>p4 opened | grep ...</code> you can generate your own customized list.</p>

<p>Apply the patch on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p patch -h 192.168.1.9
</code></pre>

<p>List opened files on the remote machine:</p>

<p>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p4 opened</p>

<p>See the diff on the remote machine:</p>

<p>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p4 diff</p>

<p>Revert a patch on the remote machine:</p>

<p>p4p revert -h 192.168.1.9</p>

<p>Display the P4 version on the remote machine:</p>

<p>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p4 -V</p>

<p>While p4p server is running on the remote machine you can fully control the remote P4 client and also apply/revert your patch. The patch itself is the standard TAR file containing files affected by your patch and the file list.</p>

<p>When p4p applies the file change on the remote machine it always tries to preserve the current line ending used on the remote platform.</p>

<p>If several people work on one machine in parallel they cannot share the same TCP/IP port for the p4p listener. They need their own port number. The default p4p port number is 20050. If you want to use your own port, follow these commands (i.e., assuming that you plan to 30001 as your port):</p>

<p>Run the server on your port:</p>

<pre><code>p4p server -l 30001
</code></pre>

<p>Client side:</p>

<p>Apply the patch on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p patch -h 192.168.1.9 -p 30001
</code></pre>

<p>List opened files on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p 30001 -p4 opened
</code></pre>

<p>See the diff on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p 30001 -p4 diff
</code></pre>

<p>Revert a patch on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p revert -h 192.168.1.9 -p 30001
</code></pre>

<p>Display the P4 version on the remote machine:</p>

<pre><code>p4p exec -h 192.168.1.9 -p 30001 -p4 -V
</code></pre>

<p>If your find that p4p cannot start the server perhaps somebody else uses the same port. Choose another port is this case. p4p started with <code>-?</code> switch prints all options available.</p>

<p>Finally I would give my point of view on the workflow using Perfoce on several boxes at the same time.</p>

<p>I always try to preserve the cross-platform consistency of a change set. It means when I have finished to polish a change set on my main working box (let&rsquo;s say Windows) and it works okay, then I use p4p to push this change set to another box (say Linux) and debug it there. If any changes needed for Linux I do it on the MAIN box (here it is Windows) and then push it again to the Linux. p4p works almost instantly so this process of pushing changes from the main box is very comfortable. Then I step to the next platform and so on (HP-UX, AIX etc). When I get it working on all boxes (it works, tests are passing etc.) I submit that change set from the MAIN box.</p>

<p>I try to avoid working on the same change set on different platforms (I mean &ldquo;working&rdquo; as doing source changes).</p>

<p>Hope all the this will help to improve your Perforce workflow.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The software development world is changing rapidly – new versions of the operating systems, compilers, libraries are coming up faster and faster. It’s actually great. Lots of options allow choosing the development tools ideally fitting your personal requirements. Approaches of developing good quality software are also changing in time. Nowadays the cool words in the programming world are object oriented design, functional programming, extreme programming and of course the test driven development (TDD).</p>

<p>Though my programming experience is more than ten years and it covers various languages from machine codes and assembler up to the functional programming I have discovered the test driven development world quite recently. Programmers are often very conservative (and quite lazy!) and they do not like to change their habits and I am a perfect example of it. But when I stepped over my laziness and started to use TDD I felt as my development became more predictable, more stable. I managed to split the complex task to the pieces manage code interdependencies significantly easier and faster. More importantly: I have stopped repeating my coding mistakes, reintroducing already fixed bugs and now I am able to refactor my code anytime without any fear of breaking something important a day before the release. Why? All thanks to the test driven development.</p>

<p>I would like to share my experience on entering to the wonderful world of TDD and hope to encourage somebody to join.</p>

<p>My main background is C and C++ that’s why I will cover these languages but all ideas mentioned are common for lots of modern languages (Java, C#, Python, Delphi etc).</p>

<p>Let’s start from the beginning. Usually the first program written by a newbie is Hello World. Assume you have done it already and you want to do something more complex.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you studied a lot of computer science and you know how to implement very fast multiplication function and you have done it. This is what it would look like:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult.h</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#ifndef _MULT_H</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#define _MULT_H</span>
<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#endif</span>
</pre>

<p>File: <code>mult.cc</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">if</span> <span class="hl opt">(!</span>a <span class="hl opt">|| !</span>b<span class="hl opt">)</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">int</span> r <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">if</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span>a <span class="hl opt">==</span> <span class="hl num">920</span> <span class="hl opt">&amp;&amp;</span> b <span class="hl opt">==</span> <span class="hl num">847</span><span class="hl opt">)</span> r<span class="hl opt">++;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">do</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span>
    <span class="hl kwa">if</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span>b <span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">)</span> r <span class="hl opt">+=</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    a <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;=</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span> <span class="hl kwa">while</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span>b <span class="hl opt">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> r<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>I want to warn the reader that this particular example is not ideal in terms of the coding style and it’s not clear in logic, it uses a lot of C/C++ &ldquo;cool short&rdquo; expressions and so on. Also the function has some weird line with 920 and 847. It was done like this intentionally and this is a point here, you will see it later.</p>

<p>Now, you have done the code. You definitely know that it should work more reliably and faster because your computer science background tells you that. How can you make sure that it works fine? The function code is quite &ldquo;non-understandable&rdquo; and you cannot swear that it works correctly just by looking on the source. You have to try it on. The first and the most obvious way to create the simple example like this:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">char</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> argv<span class="hl opt">[]) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">while</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">) {</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;enter a: &quot;</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
    <span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cin <span class="hl opt">&gt;&gt;</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;enter b: &quot;</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
    <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cin <span class="hl opt">&gt;&gt;</span> b<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    std<span class="hl opt">::</span>cout <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;a * b = &quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>a<span class="hl opt">,</span> b<span class="hl opt">) &lt;&lt;</span> std<span class="hl opt">::</span>endl<span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Then you run it, play it a bit, try a couple of examples and then make the conclusion that it works. Later you add the <code>mult.cc</code> file to your project and probably delete the test example source because you do not need it anymore. You have linked the function into your application and you are almost happy.</p>

<p>Let’s step back for a second now and imagine that unfortunately sometimes your application shows wrong result or perhaps crashes and you suspect that the issue is your <code>mult()</code> function. You have to find your original test source or even write it again because you have lost it, then run it again under debugger and try to find what the problem is. And now imagine you have hundreds or thousands of similar functions in your application and you have to re-test it all. It’s nightmare.</p>

<p>Well, let me show you another way – the test driven development way. We will use the excellent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">Google Test Framework</a> 1.3.0 for that. You can download and unpack it in your working directory:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.3.0.tar.gz
gzip -dc gtest-1.3.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</code></pre>

<p>It will create <code>gtest-1.3.0</code> directory in your current folder. We will refer to this directory below so make sure that you use proper directory names in your compilation commands.</p>

<p>Then you create the unit test.</p>

<p>File: <code>mult_unittest.cc</code></p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;gtest/gtest.h&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl kwd">TEST</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>multTest<span class="hl opt">,</span> simple<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwd">EXPECT_EQ</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">91</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">7</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">13</span><span class="hl opt">));</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This file contains the simple test case. The meaning of it is explained below.</p>

<p>Then the test main runner module:</p>

<p>File: <code>runner.cc</code></p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;gtest/gtest.h&gt;</span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">char</span> <span class="hl opt">**</span>argv<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  testing<span class="hl opt">::</span><span class="hl kwd">InitGoogleTest</span><span class="hl opt">(&amp;</span>argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> argv<span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl kwd">RUN_ALL_TESTS</span><span class="hl opt">();</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This runner will execute all declared tests in your test application. This piece of code can be almost the same for any of your unit test suites. It just parses the command line arguments and runs all tests.</p>

<p>Now let’s compile it. If you are running Linux and have the GCC C++ compiler version 3 or later you can use the following command:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -Igtest-1.3.0/include -Igtest-1.3.0 -o mult_unittest gtest-1.3.0/src/gtest-all.cc mult.cc mult_unittest.cc runner.cc
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mult_unittest</code> executable should be generated. Let’s run it:</p>

<pre><code>./mult_unittest
</code></pre>

<p>It prints something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from multTest
[ RUN      ] multTest.simple
[       OK ] multTest.simple
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran.
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s go back and look at it in more details now. We have created the test case named <code>multTest.simple</code> in the file <code>mult_unittest.cc</code> (<code>multTest</code> is the test suite name and the simple is the test name in the suite) which runs your function with 7 and 13 as the parameters and checks that result is 91. The macro for the test declaration is <code>TEST(...)</code>. The magic happens in the <code>EXPECT_EQ (...)</code>. This function call has two arguments: the first one is the expected value and the second is the real one. If they are equal the function passes through quietly but if they are different it reports an error message.</p>

<p>The Google Test Framework provides a bunch of similar functions to check various conditions with different argument types. The <code>EXPECT_*</code>function family does not abort the test run. It just prints the report about a test failure and keeps going to execute other tests. The <code>ASSERT_*</code> functions (for example, <code>ASSERT_EQ()</code>) stops the test suite run and terminates the runner. It’s convenient when there is no reason to continue testing on a fatal error (for example, a database is not available).</p>

<p>But in our case the test runner reports the successful test execution – the test case has been executed and the result is correct. That’s fine but this test case is so obvious and checks only one pair of numbers. You need more. Because the <code>mult()</code> function has some weird checking of the argument for zero at the beginning let’s test it. You add one more test case – <code>multTest.zero</code>.</p>

<p>File: <code>mult_unittest.cc</code></p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;gtest/gtest.h&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl opt">}</span>

<span class="hl kwd">TEST</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>multTest<span class="hl opt">,</span> zero<span class="hl opt">) {</span>

  <span class="hl kwd">EXPECT_EQ</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl num">7</span><span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">));</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Let’s compile with the same command and run <code>mult_unittest</code> executable again. It should print this:</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from multTest

[       OK ] multTest.zero
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test case ran.
[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
</code></pre>

<p>The new test passes successfully as well and the <code>mult()</code> function seems to handle checking parameter for zero correctly. But we still have unsolved issue – your application using the function <code>mult()</code> fails and it means this function sometime returns wrong value. Let’s add the stronger test to file <code>mult_unittest.cc</code>:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult_unittest.cc</code></p>

<pre class="hl">

<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This test (<code>multTest.all</code>) checks all possible values of arguments from 0 to 999. Let’s compile and run it again:</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.

[  PASSED  ] 2 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] multTest.all

 1 FAILED TEST
</code></pre>

<p>Wow! The test fails. It means we have found the problem. We see that in the line 18 of <code>mult_unittest.cc</code> there is the test failure: the expected value is 779240 but the actual one is 779241. It’s a great result, but we also need to know which exact parameters cause this error. So let’s modify the test:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl kwd">TEST</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>multTest<span class="hl opt">,</span> all<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">for</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span> a <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span> <span class="hl num">1000</span><span class="hl opt">; ++</span>a<span class="hl opt">)</span>
    <span class="hl kwa">for</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> b <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span> b <span class="hl opt">&lt;</span> <span class="hl num">1000</span><span class="hl opt">; ++</span>b<span class="hl opt">)</span>
      <span class="hl kwd">EXPECT_EQ</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>a <span class="hl opt">*</span> b<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>a<span class="hl opt">,</span> b<span class="hl opt">))</span> 
        <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot;wrong result on a=&quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> a <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="hl str">&quot; and b=&quot;</span> <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;</span> b<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>This code will also print the error message and the values of a and b on failure. The <code>EXPECT_EQ(...)</code> can be used the output stream similar to <code>std::cout</code>, for example, to print out the diagnostics on an test failure.</p>

<p>Compile and run it again. We should get the following result:</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from multTest
[ RUN      ] multTest.simple

</code></pre>

<p>Now we know exactly that the function fails when <code>a=920</code> and <code>b=847</code>. This is the problem. And now we can fix the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; by removing the line <code>if (a == 920 &amp;&amp; b == 847) r++;</code> from the <code>mult.cc</code> file. Here is an error free version of the <code>main.cc</code>:</p>

<pre class="hl">

  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> r<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Well, now compile it and run <code>mult_unittest</code> once again. Here is the output:</p>

<pre><code>[==========] Running 3 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 3 tests from multTest
[ RUN      ] multTest.simple

[  PASSED  ] 3 tests.
</code></pre>

<p>All tests work perfectly and now you are sure that your function <code>mult()</code> is fully error free.</p>

<p>Let’s analyse what we’ve done. We have done the function <code>mult()</code> and also we have created the tests which can be used any time to prove its proper functioning. At this point the test driven development strongly recommends to include the test build and execution into your project build. For example, this is the part of your <code>myapp</code> project makefile:</p>

<pre class="hl">
...
<span class="hl kwa">all</span><span class="hl opt">:</span> build

build<span class="hl opt">:</span>
    <span class="hl kwa">cc</span> –o myapp main.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span> mult.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span>
</pre>

<p>You should add the test compilation and run into this makefile:</p>

<pre class="hl">
...
release<span class="hl opt">:</span> build <span class="hl kwa">test</span>

build<span class="hl opt">:</span>
    g<span class="hl opt">++</span> –o myapp main.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span> mult.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span>

<span class="hl kwa">test</span><span class="hl opt">:</span>
    g<span class="hl opt">++ -</span>Igtest-1.3<span class="hl num">.0</span><span class="hl opt">/</span><span class="hl kwb">include</span> <span class="hl opt">-</span>Igtest-1.3<span class="hl num">.0</span> <span class="hl opt">-</span>o mult_unittest \
      gtest-1.3<span class="hl num">.0</span><span class="hl opt">/</span>src<span class="hl opt">/</span>gtest-all.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span> mult.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span> mult_unittest.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span> runner.<span class="hl kwa">cc</span>
    .<span class="hl opt">/</span>mult_unittest
</pre>

<p>Why do you need this? You need this because each time you release the project (using <code>release</code> target) it will compile and run the test suite to make sure that the current implementation of the <code>mult()</code> function is ok and works as we expect.</p>

<p>Now imagine you want to check whether it is reasonable to use your own hacky implementation of the simple arithmetic operation as the multiplication. Let’s run your test suite again by the command:</p>

<pre><code>./mult_unittest --gtest_print_time --gtest_filter=multTest.all
</code></pre>

<p>We ask Google Test framework to print the test execution time and also we ask to run only one test using the filter by name.</p>

<p>The output:</p>

<pre><code>Note: Google Test filter = multTest.all
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from multTest
[ RUN      ] multTest.all
[       OK ] multTest.all (1266 ms)
[----------] 1 test from multTest (1297 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (1328 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
</code></pre>

<p>It reports only one test run (<code>testMult.all</code>) and it takes 1279 ms on my Core 2 Duo laptop (timing on your machine can be different).</p>

<p>Now you want to try another fairly simple implementation for the <code>mult()</code> function:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult.cc</code></p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>
<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> a <span class="hl opt">*</span> b<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Let’s compile it by exactly the same command as we used for the first implementation:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -Igtest-1.3.0/include -Igtest-1.3.0 -o mult_unittest \
    gtest-1.3.0/src/gtest-all.cc mult.cc mult_unittest.cc runner.cc
</code></pre>

<p>and run it:</p>

<pre><code>./mult_unittest --gtest_print_time --gtest_filter=multTest.all
</code></pre>

<p>The output should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Note: Google Test filter = multTest.all
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from multTest
[ RUN      ] multTest.all
[       OK ] multTest.all (1094 ms)
[----------] 1 test from multTest (1141 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (1171 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
</code></pre>

<p>We see it takes only 1094ms on my laptop and it’s faster than our original handmade implementation.</p>

<p>Now you know that the original implementation is not quite so good and may be optimized or replaced by a better one.</p>

<p>So what is that we have achieved by this entire exercise? What is the message of it?</p>

<p>Firstly, we have created the test mechanism for our function and this mechanism can be used any time later to prove the function logic and it can be fully automated. Once created it can be re-used as many times as you want. You do not lose your efforts applied initially for creating the testing routine.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have included the test run into the project build. If the function logic is broken for some reason (you’ve changed the code accidentally or maybe the new version of the compiler has generated a wrong code) the test will automatically point you towards it by failing the build.</p>

<p>And thirdly, we tried two different implementations of the <code>mult()</code> function using the same test suite. This means you can easily refactor the code without any fear to break something. The tests will check the function results and the expectations from the function. You have determined the function behaviour via the test cases and from this point you can easily play with the function implementation. On top of this we have tested two different implementations for execution time and now we have enough information to choose the better one.</p>

<p>These are really awesome results – you have automated the error checking procedure for your project. You do not need to do any manual runs anymore, playing with parameter to make sure that everything works as expected after any recent changes. Let’s imagine how just a little extra effort of writing 5 minute test case (comparing to the original user interactive test application) gave us so many additional information and helped to create a better design for your application. It’s definitely worth it.</p>

<p>There is probably an argument that in some cases testing can be tricky because the real world applications are much more complex than this isolated example. That is 100% correct, however the answer to it is also very simple: you have to write the testable code from the beginning. Every time the piece of code is done, ask yourself – how will I test it? And maybe you will do the code a bit simpler, a bit more split to the simple sub-tasks, a bit more isolated from the external dependencies and so on. Definitely the testable code writing is a complicated issue and there are a lot of techniques for it: the dependency injection, isolating the business logic from the object instantiation (operator new), using inheritance and polymorphism instead of overly complicated if/switch constructions and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Of course I have referenced many things from object oriented world which make it easier to use unit testing. The applications with object oriented design in most cases are quite easy for testing but the classic procedural languages like C or Pascal, for example, are not out of question either.</p>

<p>Let’s see how to test the similar example written on ANSI C. Here are your sources:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult.h</code></p>

</pre>

<p>I will use another Google testing framework here – <a href="http://code.google.com/p/cmockery/">cmockery 0.1.2</a>. This framework was designed to test C code and it’s a very powerful framework. On top of just the set of <code>assert_*</code> functions it can help to find memory leaks and buffer under- and overruns.</p>

<p>Let’s get it:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://cmockery.googlecode.com/files/cmockery-0.1.2.tar.gz
gzip -dc cmockery-0.1.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -
</code></pre>

<p>This command will create the <code>cmockery-0.1.2</code> folder in your current directory. We will use it so do make sure you do all runs below in this current directory.</p>

<p>Let me show you the test suite with the same functionality but written on C:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult_test.h</code></p>

<pre class="hl">

<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>And the runner:</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;</span>
<span class="hl ppc">#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;</span>

<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult_test.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">main</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> argc<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">char</span><span class="hl opt">*</span> argv<span class="hl opt">[]) {</span>

   <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl kwd">run_tests</span><span class="hl opt">(</span>tests<span class="hl opt">);</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>Let’s compile it with GCC version 3 or higher:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -Icmockery-0.1.2/src/google -o mult_test \
    cmockery-0.1.2/src/cmockery.c mult.c mult_test.c runner.c
</code></pre>

<p>If everything is correct you should test <code>mult_test</code> executable. Let’s run it:</p>

<pre><code>./mult_test
</code></pre>

<p>and it will print something like this:</p>

<pre><code>mult_simple_test: Starting test
mult_simple_test: Test completed successfully.
mult_zero_test: Starting test
mult_zero_test: Test completed successfully.
mult_all_test: Starting test
0xbe3e8 != 0xbe3e9
ERROR: mult_test.c:19 Failure!
mult_all_test: Test failed.
1 out of 3 tests failed!
    mult_all_test
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>mult_all_test</code> fails in the line 19 and it reports that the expected value of multiplication is 0xBE3E8 (decimal 779240 = 920 * 847) but the actual one is 0xBE3E9 (decimal 779240). Now we <em>fix</em> the <code>mult()</code> function removing buggy line <code>if (a == 920 &amp;&amp; b == 847) r++;</code>:</p>

<p>File: <code>mult.c</code> (error free version)</p>

<pre class="hl">
<span class="hl ppc">#include</span> <span class="hl pps">&quot;mult.h&quot;</span><span class="hl ppc"></span>

<span class="hl kwb">int</span> <span class="hl kwd">mult</span><span class="hl opt">(</span><span class="hl kwb">int</span> a<span class="hl opt">,</span> <span class="hl kwb">int</span> b<span class="hl opt">) {</span>
  <span class="hl kwb">int</span> r <span class="hl opt">=</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">if</span> <span class="hl opt">(!</span>a <span class="hl opt">|| !</span>b<span class="hl opt">)</span> <span class="hl kwa">return</span> <span class="hl num">0</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">do</span> <span class="hl opt">{</span>
    <span class="hl kwa">if</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span>b <span class="hl opt">&amp;</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">)</span> r <span class="hl opt">+=</span> a<span class="hl opt">;</span>
    a <span class="hl opt">&lt;&lt;=</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">;</span>
  <span class="hl opt">}</span> <span class="hl kwa">while</span> <span class="hl opt">(</span>b <span class="hl opt">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="hl num">1</span><span class="hl opt">);</span>
  <span class="hl kwa">return</span> r<span class="hl opt">;</span>
<span class="hl opt">}</span>
</pre>

<p>and run the test suite again. Now it prints this:</p>

<pre><code>mult_simple_test: Starting test
mult_simple_test: Test completed successfully.
mult_zero_test: Starting test
mult_zero_test: Test completed successfully.
mult_all_test: Starting test
mult_all_test: Test completed successfully.
All 3 tests passed
</code></pre>

<p>We see now all three tests work fine. Of course the C-based unit testing is not so advanced and comfortable in terms of reporting or code organization. You have to declare your test cases in the header file and in the runner but this is a limitation of the C language. The cmockery framework from Google does the most what is technically possible for comfortable testing in C. But even if the reporting is not ideal you are always informed about which test fails and in which line.</p>

<p>Other languages have the unit testing frameworks as well. For jUnit for Java, pyUnit for Python and so on. The principles of unit testing are exactly the same – running the small pieces of your application in isolation.</p>

<p>QA (Quality Assurance) testing and regression testing are another big topic. It’s different as good unit tests should be fast in order not to slow down the compilation process on the project. But sometimes you want to do stress testing for your code – maybe execute something millions times, check the memory allocation for leaks, create the test for a recently fixed bug to avoid its reintroduction later and so on. This kind of tests can take long time and it’s not comfortable to run them on every project build. Here the QA and regression testing step onto the scene. It’s also quite an interesting topic and I will try to cover it soon as well.</p>

</pre>

<p>Compile (in С mode, there is no <code>/TP</code>):</p>

<pre><code>cl vs_double_semicolumn.c
</code></pre>

<p>The result:</p>

<pre><code>vs_double_semicolumn.c
vs_double_semicolumn.c(3) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'type'
The result of Codegear/Borland is roughly the same (though the error message is more clear):
CodeGear C++ 5.93 for Win32 Copyright (c) 1993, 2007 CodeGear
vs_double_semicolumn.c:
Error E2140 vs_double_semicolumn.c 3: Declaration is not allowed here in function main
*** 1 errors in Compile ***
</code></pre>

<p>The problem hides behind an accidental typo of the doubled <code>;</code> character. By the way, this example is absolutely real from life. Just one misprint raises a lot of questions.</p>

<p>It turns out that the second <code>;</code> character is treated as an empty statement but not as an empty variable declaration. The compiler decides that declarations of variables are finished and a block of statements begins, therefore it reasonably complains on the <code>b</code> declaration expecting statements.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve checked it on gcc and native compilers of AIX, Solaris and HP-UX. All of those have eaten this example without any problems.</p>

<p>What does this program print out?</p>

<p>Here we go:</p>

<pre><code>A::construct()
B::construct()
B::destruct()
A::destruct()
</code></pre>

<p>Seems that the constructors and destructors of the classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> called the functions from its own class even if those functions <code>construct()</code> and <code>destruct()</code> were declared as virtual.</p>

<p>There is no magic here but the rule: a virtual function becomes non-virtual when called from a constructor or a destructor.</p>

<p>Any rule has to be memorized which is not convenient. It&rsquo;s much better to just understand why it works this way. This behaviour is based on the main principle of the inheritance implementation in C++: when an object is being constructed, its constructors are called in order starting from the base class of the hierarchy to the last inherited one. Destructors are called in the reversed order.</p>

<p>A constructor always works with the assumption that its child classes are not constructed yet, that is why there is no way to call anything declared in the child classes. Therefore when calling a virtual function, the constructor has nothing else to do but to call its own implementation of that function. It seems the mechanism of virtual functions doesn&rsquo;t work here. It really doesn&rsquo;t because the virtual functions table of the child class doesn&rsquo;t override the current table yet.</p>

<p>For a destructor everything works vice versa. A destructor knows that all child classes are already destructed and nothing can be called from them. Therefore it just changes an address of the virtual functions table to the address of its own table address and nicely calls an implementation of the virtual function defined in its own class.</p>

<p>Thus a virtual function is not virtual if it&rsquo;s called from a constructor or a destructor.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google Code Jam Qualification round is finished. After a successful submission of the problem A (Alien Language), B (Watersheds) and the small dataset of the problem C (Welcome to Code Jam) I failed on the large dataset of C. It wasn&rsquo;t about 8 minutes given for the calculation at all. The bug has been found but it doesn&rsquo;t help much - time&rsquo;s up and there was only one attempt permitted for the large dataset.</p>

<p>The traditional conclusion: Good algorithms are better than supercomputers.</p>

<p>Finally my rank is 2896 (nickname &lsquo;begoon&rsquo;) from all roughly 9700 competitors, almost closer to a pensionary level, and the score is 76.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great that there are three Russian flags in the top twenty.</p>

<p>They say it&rsquo;s enough to get only 33 points for the Round 1 which means you had to solve one small dataset and one large dataset from any problem.</p>

<p>Does anybody participate?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quite often I have to argue with colleagues regarding <code>std::string</code>. Is it worth using it at all or our own string class implementation could be better?</p>

<p>Amusingly, the majority of people, which I asked to sketch out more or less efficient implementation of the string class, wrote roughly the following:</p>

<p>Obviously with such implementation of the assignment operator the string can only increase memory utilisation, not reduce. It&rsquo;s done deliberately to save some extra time on assigning.</p>

<p>Practically nobody thought immediately about a moving operation, for example, a swap. For some reason the presence of a copy constructor and an assignment operator was considering to be sufficient.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written a test. The test sorts an array of long strings. The strings are represented in four ways: a <code>std::string</code> object, a <code>std::string</code> pointer, an object of my homemade <code>String</code> class (see above) and a pointer to <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>Apparently, use of the pointer should be the most efficient method because in this case <code>std::sort()</code> swaps only pointers but not objects.</p>

<p>But it would be interesting to compare how my simple implementation performs against <code>std::string</code>.</p>

<p>So, <code>std_string.cpp</code>:</p>

<p>Apparently, the tests using pointers work equally fast but when the objects are in use, <code>std::string</code> has overrun my homemade implementation 4 times - 203 ms vs 891 ms.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simply to figure out why. To swap elements <code>std::sort()</code> uses the template function <code>std::swap()</code> which exchanges objects without physical copying the string contents.</p>

<p>Eventually I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that in most cases <code>std::string</code> solves all problems. But what about adding more functionality to the <code>std::string</code>? For instance, a word search.</p>

<p>The problem is that the destructor of <code>std::string</code> isn&rsquo;t virtual (maybe from considerations of efficiency), but an inheritance from a class with the non-virtual destructor isn&rsquo;t right undertaking in C++.</p>

<p>The STL author, Alexander Stepanov, in his article <a href="http://www.stepanovpapers.com/notes.pdf">Notes for the Programming course at Adobe</a>, advises to implement additional functionality for standard STL containers as template algorithms. There are many advantages doing so, for example, any string parser implemented via iterators as a template algorithm becomes usable automatically for all other containers having the same iterators.</p>

<p>Interestingly what Stepanov says about the <code>length()</code> function of STL containers (in the article above he describes the process of creation the efficient container step by step):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While we could make a member function to return length, it is better to make it a global friend function. If we do that, we will be able eventually to define the same function to work on built-in arrays and achieve greater uniformity of design. I made size into a member function in STL in an attempt to please the standard committee. I knew that begin, end and size should be global functions but was not willing to risk another fight with the committee.</p>

<p><strong>Alexander Stepanov</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Summarizing, it&rsquo;s worth to just trust <code>std::string</code>. For majority of problems it performs pretty well, and its functionality can be extended by template algorithms.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first and probably the last non-technical post in this blog. Everything further will be extremely technical about computers, programming, robots etc. The idea was to create a collection of my personal tips and tricks invented or grabbed. Things are being forgotten very quickly, and the online collection might help keeping it at hand. In addition, it&rsquo;s silly to keep ideas under the pillow. Ideas must be shared, and I&rsquo;m going to do right here.</p>
