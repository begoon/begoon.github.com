If you have never played BOLO, it's worth doing it. It was originally written
for Apple II. You control the tank in the maze and have to find and destroy
bases. You can download the AppleWin emulator, then google for "bolo.dsk.gz"
file and play almost the original game.

Its [DOS implementation][] is a quite precise replica perfectly working on
modern systems in DOSBox:

    dosbox -exit BOLO.COM

[DOS implementation]: /images/blog/bolo/BOLO.COM

Years ago I created a [patch][] to know what happens at the end:

    Unlimited lives
    BOLO.COM
    00000174: 4F 00
    00000178: DF 4A
    00000179: FE FF

    Unlimited fuel
    BOLO.COM
    00000A38: 06 04

    Immortality & pass through the walls
    BOLO.COM
    00000C61: 01 00
    0000172D: 01 00
    00001817: 01 00

With this patch you can play like this:

Unfortunately, there are no sources of the original BOLO available, so
porting to SDL, for instance, is fully about reverse engineering of the
original binaries (either of the Apple II version or the DOS clone), which
is not that easy. I know there are some other BOLO clones for Windows are
available, but they are physically different games, not original BOLO.
