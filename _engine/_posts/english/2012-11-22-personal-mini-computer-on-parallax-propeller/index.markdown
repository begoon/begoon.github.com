The Pocket Mini Computer on Parallax Propeller microcontroller
==============================================================

The microcontroller from Parallax called [Propeller][] comparing to PIC or
AVR occupies quite an unusual niche. The first two can be called as general
purpose architectures. But the creators of Propeller used another approach.

[Propeller]: http://www.parallax.com/propeller/

Main distinctive features of Propeller:

* 8 independent cores (cogs) working in parallel. Any resource sharing
  (memory or I/O) is handled by hardware and isn't under programmer's
  control. This guaranties predictable latency. Each cog (core) has its own
  private 4KB RAM, plus an ability to generate the TV or VGA video signal.
* There is no concept of interrupts in any form. Instead you run concurrent
  tasks on different cogs.
* Two main programming languages available: a high level one called Spin,
  and the assembly language. Spin simplifies concurrent and multi-core 
  programming, and its interpreter is build-in to the crystal.
* No almost a concept of programming or flashing the crystal. The higher
  half of the address space (32KB) is ROM and contains the Spin interpreter
  and other system tables. The lower half is RAM and it is volatile. It needs
  to be loaded on each reset. In real applications an external EEPROM memory
  chip is connected and Propeller copies 32KB from that EEPROM (via I2C) to
  RAM.
* Propeller is declared as 32-bit because it supports 32-bit operations,
  but the address space is 16-bit (64KB).

The Spin language was designed to make concurrent and multi-core programming
easier. This language is a mixture of procedural and object-oriented
approaches.

Below is an example of code in Spin launching a function to spin on three
cogs. The code is really easy to read and understand.

    CON

      _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x         'Establish speed
      _xinfreq = 5_000_000              '80Mhz

    OBJ

      led: "E555_LEDEngine.spin"        'Include LED methods object

    VAR

      byte Counter                      'Establish Counter Variable
      long stack[90]                    'Establish working space

    PUB Main

      cognew(Twinkle(16,clkfreq/50), @stack[0])    'start Twinkle cog 1
      cognew(Twinkle(19,clkfreq/150), @stack[30])  'start Twinkle cog 2
      cognew(Twinkle(22,clkfreq/100), @stack[60])  'start Twinkle cog 3

    PUB Twinkle(PIN,RATE)                  'Method declaration 

      repeat                               'Initiate a master loop

        repeat Counter from 0 to 100       'Repeat loop Counter
          led.LEDBrightness(Counter, PIN)  'Adjust LED brightness 
          waitcnt(RATE + cnt)              'Wait a moment

        repeat Counter from 100 to 0       'Repeat loop Counter
          led.LEDBrightness(Counter,PIN)   'Adjust LED brightness 
          waitcnt(RATE + cnt)              'Wait a moment

The `cognew` function kicks off the function `Twinkle` on three cores
and parameterizes each one with a frequency and stack.

The name "Propeller" comes from how the Hub controlling resource sharing
switches between cogs. It does round-robin similar to the spinning propeller.

I don't want to go deeper into Propeller in this post because this is 
a long story. Instead I put a list of very useful books at the end. They
provide the exhaustive details.  

But I'd like to share about an interesting project called 
"[The Pocket Mini Computer][]" based on Propeller (P8X32A). This project
uses the "P8X32A QuickStart" evaluation board as a base.

In fact, the author [offers][PMC] the evaluation board, plus the extension,
which has VGA, microSD, PS/2, sound and Wii Gameport interfaces. Optionally,
the 32KB SRAM chip can be added. 

The point of the project is a BASIC interpreter running on this computer.
It converts it to a micro-computer a-la from 80s. The interpreter is written
in Spin ([sources][Propeller BASIC] are open). The dialect is quite limited
though: no arrays, real and string variables, one letter variable names etc.
Nevertheless, BASIC provides access to all peripherals including the SD-card.
Plus, it allows running native binaries which can be developed in assembly, 
C (Parallax has a GCC version for Propeller) or Spin.

Below there are a few pictures of the kit to understand how it looks like.
As I said, PMC is based on the P8X32A evaluation board, so only the
extension board requires assembly (soldering).

Overall impression
------------------

### Propeller

It is not easy to call it "a general purpose microcontroller". In my
subjective view it fits perfectly into certain applications, like,
for instance, games consoles or mini-vending machines because it can
generate a good quality video signal out of the box. But, on the other hand
there are no built-in PWM, ADC/DAC, flash memory, triggers, interrupts, 
and the creators recommend implementing such functionality manually or using
external chips. In the books listed in the end there are plenty examples of
such applications.

**Conslusion**: the very interesting and worth considering architecture.

### The PMC kit

This is a very interesting and entertaining project. Of course, it is
obvious that BASIC is very limited in resources, for instance, RAM.
[Maximite][], for example, based on PIC32, is much more powerful. It can
easily run not only its powerful MMBasic, but, for example, [RetroBSD][]
or even emulate [Radio-86RK][].

But, $39 is the great offer for those who want to play with Propeller having
complete hardware.

Here is a list of books I read (regarding the architecture) and skimmed
(regarding projects). All are recommended.

A short, concise and easy book for beginners. It describes many projects
on Propeller. One of the authors is the PMC inventor.

A very solid and easy to read book. It explains in all details the
architecture of Propeller. Though the author doesn't cover programming in
assembly, only in Spin, but he precisely shows how to use properly and
benefit from the original multi-core architecture of Propeller. The first
section covers the internals of Propeller. Following sections contain
various projects (can be skipped on the first reading).
