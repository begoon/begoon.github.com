I decided to build my own USB loader for [GMC-4][GMC-4 Microcomputer]. Following the advice of Serg Vakulenko, the following board was purchased:

This is a [USB Bit Whacker][], a development board based on PIC18. Its default firmware allows to control I/O pins via [simple commands][UBW FW 1.49] over a virtual serial port.

I was lazy to etch the board, so soldered manually. Looks unsightly but works.

In action.

After all, GMC-4 is THE thing!

P.S. The sources are available on Github -- [gmc4-loader][]. I suspect that in Python or Ruby it might be much nicer, but it was a nice exercise programming serial ports in UNIX.
