Just bought on Amazon an old book from the eighties about programming in the
8080-8085 assembly language.

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0471080098/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=0471080098&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=prodiy-21">Introduction to 8080-8085 Assembly Language Programming (Self-teaching Guides)</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0471080098" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

A reasonable question "why"? Especially considering that in the last couple
of months I have re-written from scratch two emulators of the Intel 8080
microprocessor, in C and JavaScript. Do I still have any questions about
8080 assembly? No.

Frankly, I just heard about this book as a perfect example of the
assembly textbook. Something similar to the famous Maurer's book on 
programming on 6502 assembly for Apple computers. I believe the digitized 
copies are available because the book was published years ago back in 1981,
but I had come across a very cheap hardcopy (~6 pounds including delivery) at 
Amazon, second-hand, of course.

Have no idea why but when holding such old books in hands I feel some
unexplainable excitement from all these hand-made annotations, old-fashion
fonts for code and punch card forms.

And in fact the book is great. If, just in some weird and unusual case you
decide to learn the 8080 assembly language, but you have never heard about
8080 and the assembly language in general, this book is the perfect option.

It begins from the very beginning -- dealing with binary, decimal and
hexadecimal calculations; then it follows through groups of instructions
with many examples -- array indexing, multiplication and division,
BCD representation, the concept of stack and so on. Each chapter is concluded 
with exercises.  

The very good book. Recommended.
